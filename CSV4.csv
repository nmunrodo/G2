Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Right IJ CVL


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52368**] is a 59M w HepC cirrhosis c/b grade I/II esophageal
varices and portal gastropathy (last EGD [**3-/2150**]), who p/w
coffee-ground emesis and melena x2 days.
.
Pt was in his USOH until about 2-3 days PTA, when he began
experiencing intermittent nausea. He had 2-3 episodes of
coffee-ground emesis and 1 episode of tarry black stool in the
morning of admission. He reports some lightheadedness which is
not new, but denies frank hematemesis, BRBPR, abdominal pain,
fever, chills, significant increases in his abdominal girth. He
denies drinking or medication non-compliance. He also reports
taking naproxen for back pain 2-3 times a day in the recent
past.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 97.4, 93/41, 69, 18, 100% on RA. He
was given 4L NS IV, protonix 40mg IV, started on an octreotide
drip. He had guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam. He was
seen by the liver fellow in the ED who felt this was unlikely a
variceal bleed and recommended work up for infection. An NG tube
was attempted, however, patient was unable to tolerate it in the
ED. Abdominal ultrasound was done which showed a patent portal
vein, scant ascites but not enough to tap. BP dropped to 80/34,
pt transferred to MICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
.
In the MICU, pt was given 3 pRBC, Hct bumped from 21.3 to 28.
Started on norepinephrine gtt for a few hours, but BP
stabilized. On transfer to the floor, remains hemodynamically
stable. Feels good, denies tarry or bloody BMs, emesis.

Past Medical History:
HCV Cirrhosis (tx with interferon x2 with no response)
Portal Gastropathy
Grade II Esophageal varices
HTN

Social History:
He lives alone.  He is drinking alcohol, usually one session per
week. He has four to five drinks per session. He was told to
completely abstain from alcohol, effective as of today. He
smokes about 20 cigarettes per day.

admitted w coffee-ground emesis and melena concerning for UGIB,
s/p MICU stay for hypotension.
.
# UGIB: Pt did not have any more bleeds while in hospital. EGD
revealed erythema and erosion in the antrum and pylorus
compatible with non-steroidal induced gastritis. Pt did remember
taking increased doses of naproxen for backache. Started on
pantoprazole 40mg PO BID for one week with repeat endoscopy
scheduled in one week ([**4-30**]). Recommended to take tylenol (max
daily dose of 2gm) for pain instead of NSAIDs. Blood pressure
meds were held at first, given MICU admission for hypotension,
but were restarted on discharge.
.
# HCV Cirrhosis: appears to be progressing to liver failure,
with elevated INR at 1.6, decreased albumin at 2.6, tbili
slightly elevated at 3.6, and chronic LE edema. Pt was continued
on prophylactic medications.

Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the apex and septum. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=30-35%).
The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Focal
abnormalities are seen in the mid and apical anteroseptal wall,
apical anterior wall, mid and apical inferoseptal wall, apical
inferior wall. NO thrombus was seen in LV apex.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with focal
calcification of the non-coronary cusp which moves poorly. There
is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve
prolapse or flail segments. There is no pericardial effusion.
Postbypass
The patient is A-paced and on a phenylephrine infusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Mitral
regurgitation remains mild-to-moderate. The thoracic aorta is
intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2162-5-17**] where the patient underwent Coronary
artery bypass graft x 4. See operative note for details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The Electrophysiology team was consulted now due to non
capturing atrial lead after permanent pacemaker was initially
interrogated and epicardial wires were removed. Ventricular lead
and ICD were functioning appropriately. The right atrial lead
was revised on [**5-19**] without complication. He is to follow up the
device clinic at [**Hospital1 **] in 2 weeks - operative note was given
to patient to bring to follow up appointment. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Lisinopril was restarted for better blood pressure. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes were discontinued without complication on post
operative day 3. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the sternal and pacer pocket wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics. He is to continue on 1 week
of antibiotics per EP s/p atrial lead placement.  The patient
was discharged home with VNA services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.  All follow up appointments
were arranged.

cervical spine
CT torso - Extensive pulmonary contusions, worse on the right
than the left. Hepatic lacerations with a small amount of
abdominal and pelvic free fluid of intermittent density.
Bilateral rib fractures.
Right femur/knee xrays - There is a mid shaft femoral fracture
with mild varus angulation of the distal fragment relative to
the proximal. There is also medial subluxation by ~ 1 cortical
width.

[**9-2**]
MRI cspine - Edema in the interspinous ligaments from C3-C4
through C7-T1, without evidence of distraction. lobal central
canal narrowing due to congenital short pedicles. This is
slightly exacerbated by a disc bulge at C3-4. No cord signal
abnormality. Moderate right C4-5 neural foramen narrowing due to
uncovertebral osteophytes.

[**9-3**]
Bilateral LE LENIs - No deep venous thrombosis involving the
right or left lower extremity.
LUE LENI -  No deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.

[**9-7**]
CT Abdomen/Pelvis - Right pleural effusion with associated
compressive atelectasis. Considerable improvement in the
appearance of the right lobe of the liver laceration. Small
amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Fractures of the left first
and right fourth and fifth ribs. Fracture of
the right transverse process of T1.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU.

[**8-29**] - Patient was admittd to the ICU. He was taken to the
operation room with ortho for ORIF of his right femur (see
operative report for full details).  Neurosurgery was consulted
and an ICP was placed.  He was started on dilantin and q1 hour
neurochecks.

[**Date range (1) 58392**] - The patient was transfused 4u PRBC for a decreasing
Hct.  He had a right femur hematoma which was expanding but his
limb was soft and there was no fear of compartment symdrome.
His Hct stabilized. Head CT was stable.

[**9-1**] - His ICP was discontinued and neurosurgery signed off.
Head CT was stable.

[**9-2**] - MR of head and c-spine were performed.

[**9-3**] - Bilateral LE and LUE LENIs were performed which
demonstrated no DVT.

[**9-4**] - The patient went the OR with the acute care service for
tracheostomy and IVC filter placement.

[**9-6**] - Patient dc'ed his dophoff tube twice.

[**9-7**] - A CT A/P was done because of persistent fevers and rising
white count.  No source for his fevers was identified.  Patient
was put to trach collar.

[**9-8**]: Awake, off-versed, following commands. Passed S&S for
regular diet and Passy [**Last Name (un) 87596**] Valve. BAL cultures grew MRSA, kept
only on Vanc now. Patient ready to be transferred to floor,
waiting for a bed. `

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
slow progress.  His trach tube was plugged with a PMV and he
tolerated it well.  After confirming no aspiration by video
swallow he was tolerating a regular diet with thin liquids.

The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy services followed
him on a daily basis to increase his mobility and increase
cognitive abilities.  His memory is decreased and he
occasionally has some confusion but is improving each day.

He has a PICC line placed on [**2177-9-12**] for IV antibiotics and will
require Vancomycin thru [**2177-9-16**] for MRSA pneumonia.  He has
minimal secretions but is undergoing nebulizer treatments.

Potentially his IVC filter can be removed but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will re
evaluate in a few weeks therefore he will need to return to the
[**Hospital 2536**] Clinic. He will also follow up in the Neuro cognitive clinic
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following his discharge from rehab.

After a lonfg hospitalization he was transferred to rehab on
[**2177-9-12**] for further therapy with the goal to return home soon.

History of Present Illness:
54 year old Spanish speaking male, in the US on vacation, with a
questionable PMH of liver disease presents after
jumping?falling? out a window.  Per his daughter he was drinking
alcohol with his son and reported feeling that someone was out
to kill him.  He locked himself in a second-story bedroom and
was later found by his daughter crawling outside.  He was
initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] and found to have opiates and
cocaine on UA in the emergency department there.  He was
transported to [**Hospital1 18**] with b/l ankle fractures.  Per family, the
pt has been confused at home.  In [**Name (NI) **], pt was aggitated and
received haldol and ativan.  He was later somnolent.  EKG
demonstrated atrial flutter with HRs in 110-140's, rate
controlled in the ED with IV diltiazem.

Pertinent Results:
CT C-Spine: negative for fracture
Left tib/fib: Comminuted fracture of the calcaneus. Dense sliver
of bone along the medial aspect of the proximal fibula, seen
only on a single view.  This could represent additional
calcification of the intraosseous ligament, a small cortical
fracture fragment, or a foreign body.
Right tib/fib: Comminuted, intraarticular, impacted, and
displaced fractures of the distal tibia as well as fracture of
the distal fibula as detailed above.
.
CT bilat LE
1. Comminuted intra-articular distal right tibial fracture.
2. Comminuted distal right fibular fracture with displacement.
3. Comminuted left calcaneal fracture.
.
RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: The liver is coarse in echotexture without evidence of
focal lesion. The gallbladder is not distended due to nonfasting
stage. No evidence of gallstones. No evidence of intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation and the common duct
measures 3 mm. The pancreas is not well visualized due to bowel
gas. There is no evidence of free fluid. The main portal vein is
patent with antegrade flow.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis.
.
Head CT ([**8-21**])
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology,
including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR ([**8-21**])
No previous studies for comparison. Low lung volumes. Heart size
is difficult to evaluate in this semi-upright AP film. There
could be some LVH but no evidence for CHF and the lungs are
clear. Questionable slight impression on the right margin of the
tracheal air column which can be better evaluated by standard PA
and lateral chest films when condition permits.
.
Chest CT ([**8-23**]):
1. No juxtatracheal mass or left upper lobe lesion as questioned
on chest radiograph report.
2. Three foci of ground glass, right upper lobe, not detectable
on routine radiographs, a nonspecific finding. Six- month CT
follow up is recommended to look for change, because
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, though unlikely, cannot be
excluded.
3. Borderline size mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes should be
checked on followup CT.
4. Mild atherosclerotic coronary artery calcification.

Chest CTA ([**8-24**]):
1. No pulmonary embolism.

2. Relatively unchanged appearance of multiple ill-defined
opacities and tiny nodules in the right upper lobe. Follow-up
stated on the examination from 1 day prior is again recommended.


3. New foci of opacification present at the lung bases compared
to examination from one day prior likely related to aspiration.
Layering debris present within the right main stem bronchus most
suggestive of aspiration as well. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

4. Recommend advancing NG tube at least 4-5 cm. The current
position elevates the risk of further aspiration.
.
CT RLE with contrast ([**8-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Comminuted distal tibial and fibular fractures with
intra- articular involvement of the tibial plafond and lateral
displacement of the talus with respect to the tibia. Posterior
displacement of the distal fibular fragment.
.
CT LLE without contrast ([**8-24**])
Comminuted left calcaneal fracture.
Lentiform area of fluid attenuation at the skin on the
posterolateral aspect of the left foot. The significance of the
latter finding is uncertain, but may be due to a skin blister or
possibly dressing material within the cast. Clinical correlation
requested.
.
CXR ([**8-26**])
1. NG tube could be advanced several centimeters for standard
positioning, as described in prior exams.
2. New perihilar opacities, likely due to acute aspiration in
the superior segments.
.
Head CT ([**9-3**])
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of hemorrhage or CT evidence of
acute infarct.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**9-22**]):
IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of pyelonephritis or abscess within
the abdomen/pelvis.
.
CT LLE without contrast ([**9-26**])
1. Markedly comminuted fracture of the calcaneus with wide
distraction and dispersal of the fracture fragments as above.
2. Non-displaced fractures of the sustentaculum tali and of the
middle facet of the talus.
3. No fracture identified of the medial malleolus.
4. Non-displaced fractures of the anterior aspect and of the
inferior aspect of the lateral malleolus.
5. Non-displaced fracture of the cuboid.
6. No fracture identified of the navicular.
7. No other fractures identified within the remainder of the mid
foot or the forefoot.
8. Lateral subluxation of the peroneal tendons with respect to
the fibula.
9. Probable tear of the anterior talofibular ligament.
.
Echo ([**9-26**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Transmitral
and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function,
and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral

regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
During course of hospitalization, pt was put on CIWA scale for
EtOH withdrawal and given thiamine, folate and a multivitamin,
his AFib with RVR was initially treated with metoprolol, then
diltiazem, his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose.
His b/l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics.

The patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion
during this hospitalization, requiring three codes puples to be
called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both
the patient and the staff.

The patient was originally sent from the floor to the MICU with
delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation.  He required
increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor
after a NG tube was placed. Once returned to the floor, the
patient required less sedation, was taken off of any
benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints.

The patient remained somnolent and delerious.  He pulled out his
NG tube.  He was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor.  He
was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl, which was
changed to azithro/ceftriaxone/flagyl.  He was scheduled to
return to the OR for revision of his right external fixation.
In preop holding, he was found to be hypoxic and sent to the
MICU.

MICU COURSE:  Morning of [**8-28**], patient scheduled to return to OR
for revision of externally fixated RLE. Upon transport to PACU,
patient became more somnolent and had reported ""agonal
breathing"". O2 sats 83% on 2LNC and NRB applied with O2 sats to
100%. BP in 90s/60s, HR in 80s, RR 17-19. ABG drawn: 7.38/58/90.
 During stay in MICU, patient coughed up large amount of thick
sputum with improved respiratory status.  Surgery postponed and
patient transferred to MICU for further monitoring. In the MICU,
respiratory status has remained stable with Sp02 in the high 90s
on room air.  Pt is hemodynamically stable in chronic a-flutter.
 Called out to floor on [**8-29**]- no further intensive care needs
identified.

In the MICU, patient was started on Zosyn and restarted on
Vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status.
Within a few days of returning to the floor, Vancomycin and
zosyn were stopped as CXR showed resolution of questionable
aspiration pneumonia - this was felt to be more likely
pneuomonitis which resolved.
.
After the MICU, patient's delirium started to improve, but then
worsened when he returned to the OR for removal of external
fixation.  He developed fevers to 102F post-operatively which
likely worsened delirium.  Source of fevers unclear - of note
patient had recently developed VRE in his urine but infectious
disease did not feel this was an active infection.  he received
three days of antibiotics (daptomycin and then linezolid).  When
these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to
lift.
.
#Aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol.  Zyprexa was
tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute
aggitation.  QTc was monitored while patient was on
antipsychotics and was stable at approximately 420-440msec.
Overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was
thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use,
hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine use, and post-operative
delririum.  Although spanish-speaking 1:1 sitters and
interpreters were employed as much as possible, language also
likely contributed to persistance of delirium. Delirium has
completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free.
All haldol has been stopped. He has past the period of etoh
withdrawal.  It is recommended that patient follow up with
alcohol abuse counseling.
.
#Afib/flutter
While febrile, his afib/flutter was complicated by more frequent
episodes of rapid ventricular rate.  This was controlled with IV
metoprolol when needed but also by increasing PO metoprolol and
diltiazem.  Treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help.  He
was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation,
but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by CHADS
criteria and also because of high fall risk.  Patient was
transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on Diltiazem 120mg
daily.
.
#Urinary retention
patient failed several voiding trials.  He also pulled out his
foley on several occasions, causing hematuria.  Intermittent
straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of
long-term indwelling foley.  However given delirium and
aggitation this was untenable.  This resolved with reductions in
haldol. Patient now able to void freely on his own. History of
VRE on urine culture, but no signs of infection, dyruria,
increased urinary frequency. There is no evidence based
literature or other clinical indications to treat this
asymptomatic bacteuria at this time.
.
#Fractures
patient followed by orthopedics during admission.  L ankle
fractures treated with casting, however repeat plain films and
CT scan 4-6 weeks post-op showed fractures which were not
initially visualized. Orthopedics felt casting was still
appropriate and that there was no indication for surgery. R
pilon fracture managed initially with external fixation system
because of skin breakdown making internal fixation difficult.
One month into hospitalization ex-fix removed and tibial and
fibular plates were placed.  He is to remain Non-weight bearing
for a total of one month after his hospital discharge. Patient
has completed the necessary course of lovenox.He has a follow up
appointment scheduled with his orthopaedic surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 33 year old male with
no significant past medical history who initially presented
to the [**Company 191**] Outpatient Clinic on [**11-27**] with four days of
high fevers (103 degrees F), nonproductive cough, malaise,
diffuse myalgias, mild resting dyspnea, no exposure to ill
contacts.  On [**2199-11-27**] his vital signs in the office

and respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 89% on room air.
Weight was 238 lbs.  Nonspecific pulmonary examination was
appreciated at the time.  He was prescribed Levaquin 500 mg
p.o. q.d. and discharged to home.  He represented to his
outpatient [**Hospital 191**] Clinic on [**2199-12-3**] complaining of
persistent fever to 102 degrees F, weakness, bilious emesis,
worsening dyspnea, and nonproductive cough.  Vital signs in
the office were temperature 97.3, blood pressure 108/70,
respiratory rate 20, heartrate 108, oxygen saturation 70% on
room air.  No wheezes were noted on examination.  He was

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory findings on admission revealed
white blood cell count 8.4, 73% neutrophils, 0 bands, 19
lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, hematocrit 43.8, platelets 104, MCV
83, RDW 13.0, sodium 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 92,
bicarbonate 29, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, glucose 129.
Arterial blood gases on 100% nonrebreather, PH 7.49, carbon

Imaging:  [**2199-11-27**], chest x-ray, normal, no acute
cardiopulmonary process.  Chest x-ray [**2199-12-3**], (on
admission), patchy right upper lobe, right middle lobe
infiltrate and diffuse right greater than left interstitial
pattern, normal mediastinum, no effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 33 year old male with no past medical
history originally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with
hypoxia, bilateral pneumonia, received Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin, and then Doxycycline was added since he had a
parakeet at home (he also has rats at home).  He underwent a
bronchoscopy and had a computed tomographic angiography of
the thorax which demonstrated right middle lobe and right
lower lobe pulmonary emboli with a question of infarction.
He was subsequently heparinized.  His human immunodeficiency
virus test was negative.  He received Bactrim and steroids
for a few days but were stopped when his human
immunodeficiency virus test came back negative.  A
hypercoagulability workup was pending when he arrived on the
floor in stable condition.  On arrival to the floor he was
clinically improving on the heparin drip, Ceftriaxone,
Azithromycin, and Doxycycline.  The further studies that were
obtained while in the Intensive Care Unit included [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]
which was negative, an ANCA which was negative, hepatitis
panel which was negative.  LENIS demonstrated no deep vein
thrombosis, a thrombosis of the right lesser saphenous vein,
echocardiogram was obtained as well on [**12-6**], that
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%, a mildly dilated
right ventricle and mild tricuspid regurgitation.  The chest
computerized tomography scan mentioned above was on [**12-4**] and that demonstrated multiple small pulmonary emboli
(right lower lobe and right middle lobe) and bilateral
atypical pneumonias.  Workup for the organism of said
pneumonia was undertaken.  He had negative viral culture,
negative Chlamydia, negative leptospirosis, negative C.
Psittaci and negative mycoplasmas.  Blood cultures were
negative as well.  He was maintained on Azithromycin and
completed a 14 day course for his pneumonia.  The Doxycycline
was withdrawn.  He completed a ten day course of Ceftriaxone.
Regarding the pulmonary emboli, he remained hemodynamically
stable on a heparin drip throughout his admission.  A repeat
computerized tomography scan of the thorax demonstrated
bilateral expanded heterogenous soft tissue densities within
the rectus abdominis muscle ? hematomas, partial resolution
of bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities, left SVC,
however, no pulmonary emboli.  Given the discrepancy between
the [**12-4**] and [**12-11**], computerized tomography
scans, it would be very difficult to prove that there were no
pulmonary emboli on the [**12-4**] film.  The decision to
anticoagulate him for three to six months and then to pursue
further evaluation was made.  Regarding his anticoagulation
workup, the patient had a positive anticardiolipin IgM
(46.9).  This is an intermediate range value.  The IgG
anticardiolipin value was 1.6.  The patient had a normal PTT
on admission.  While we can not make the diagnosis of
anticardiolipin syndrome on a single value, the finding
stands as nonspecific, however, the anticardiolipin panel
will have to be repeated in six weeks.  The patient was
subsequently continued on anticoagulation for pulmonary
emboli.  His heparin drip was discontinued by discharge where
he was bridged to Coumadin with Lovenox.  Regarding the
rectus hematomas noted on computerized axial tomography scan,
this finding is commonly seen in the setting of
anticoagulation.  The patient concurrently had fevers
maximally to 101 degrees F.  There was concern perhaps the
fevers may be attributable to the hematoma or a local
infection thereabouts.  He was started on Clindamycin in
conjunction with the Infectious Disease Consult Service's
recommendations.  He completed a ten day course of
Clindamycin.

Finally, the patient was noted to have a drop in his
hematocrit during his anticoagulation.  He was guaiac
negative.  There was no other source for bleed identified.
It is likely he bled into the abdominal hematoma attributing
for the drop in hematocrit.  The patient was also
intermittently hyponatremic during his stay, likely secondary
to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secondary
to the thoracic processes (namely bilateral pneumonia,
pulmonary embolisms) on this admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Bilobar pneumonia with atypical fevers
2.  Pulmonary embolus
3.  Rectus hematoma
4.  Anticardiolipin antibody IgM positive
5.  Hyponatremia
6.  Anemia

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his primary
provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] the week following discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He will be discharged on Lovenox
bridge to Coumadin.  He was also discharged on Clindamycin to
complete his ten day course.

normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.5 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a small left pleural effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
OR.

POST-BYPASS:
For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and was AV paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 11 mmHg and cardiac output of 2.6 L/min). Trivial central
aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal.
3. Right ventricular systolic function post-bypass is moderately
hypokinetic.
4. The intra-atrial septum is dynamic.
5. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

INTERPRETATION

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: an
immature population of cells consistent with acute myelogenous
leukemia.  Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) 40124**] to be consistent with
a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Correlation with
morphologic and cytogenetic findings is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o M presenting after syncopal episode found to have
multiple small ICH and new pancytopenia.  Had complicated course
of AMPL treatment

# Leukemia: Patient found to have AMPL via bone marrow biopsy
the day of admission to the MICU.  He was started on ATRA and
monitored closely for symptoms of DIC, TLS and ATRA syndrome.
He was transfused as needed with PRBC, platlets and FFP.  He did
not develop overt signs of DIC.  He was induced with Ara-c and
daunurubicin.  His counts responded appropriatly.  A repeat BM
biopsy showed remission and he will continue the ATRA for now
and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for plans of stage two of his
treatment.
.
# Fevers: He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first
starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home, but as his
culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his
antibiotics were discontinued.  He remained afebrile until [**4-14**]
when he spiked a fever.  He was cultured and his blood grew
strep viridans.  He was started on vanco/cefepime at that time.
He also had a headache the day he spiked and a CT was done
showing what appeared to be brain abscesses.  His antibiotics
were eventually broadened to vanco, meropenem, fluconzaole and
flagyl for the brain abscesses.  He continued to spike, though
for approximately a week.  He complained of some thigh pain and
we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections.  They
were drained in IR and grew MSSA.  He then developed a pneumonia
during his febrile period and was transferred to the ICU for
several days.  He required O2 for a while after being discharged
from the ICU.  While in the ICU, his neutrophil count started to
drop, and it was worried that he might be having a drug effect.
His vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover.
Eventually he was on meropenem, voriconazole and acyclovir and
stopped having fevers.  A repeat CT scan showed resolution of
his PNA.  Serial repeat head CTs showed slow decrease in size of
his abscesses.  And an MRI of his thigh showed retained small
fluid collections bilaterally.  The plan is to complete 6 week
course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses.  We
will reimage his thighs with an MRI as an outpatient and
depending on those results, he will either need surgical
drainage or still prolonged course of abx.  He will follow up
with ID.
.
# ICH: Pt with multiple small ICH sustained from fall with acute
left sided head injury in the setting of profound
thrombocytopenia. CT head revealed small foci of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. (no
hydrocephalus or shift).  On [**3-24**] follow-up Head CT revealed
interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline
shift or infarction.  The pt's neurologic exam remained stable.
Neurosurgery followed closely.  Platlet goal was  > 75K.  A
repeat head CT one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses
that were discussed above.  Neuro onc was consulted and followed
along.  It was decided not to do a biopsy.  He also required
heparin and then lovenox for DVTs, and repeat head CTs while on
these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds.
.
# Thigh pain/weakness: Etiology unclear and unable to get good
exam as limited by pain. This may be bone marrow pain.  No
evidence of hematoma or cellulitis.  No bowel or bladder
dysfunction, no saddle anesthesia, no focal spinal tenderness to
indicate acute cord compression.  MRI or the T/L-spine revealed
no evidence of acute cord compression.  There was evidence of
layering fluid likely from the SAH.  Although unlikely to be
causing the pt's leg pain (nerve irritation secondary to blood)
Neurosurgery recommended starting Decadron on [**2182-3-24**].  He was
not kept on decadron because chemotherapy was initiated.
Eventually he was found to have abscesses in his thighs, as
discussed above.
.
# Afib - pt went into afib while in the ICU.  His blood
pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol.  His
high rates were 130s-140s; he contined to have afib on and off
for about a week and then remained in NSR the week prior to
discharge.  His metoprolol was titrated to 25 mg tid for good
rate control.
.
# [**Name (NI) 6059**] - pt had one episode of 16 b [**Name (NI) 6059**] v. afib with aberrancy.
 Cards was consulted and we did agressive electrolyte repletion
and continued the metoprolol.  He did not have any more
occurrences.
.
# Vasovagal bradycardia - the day prior to admission, while the
patient was having a bowel movement, he was noted on telemetry
to brady to the 30s, he felt light headed and it resolved in 5
minutes.  Appeared to be vaso-vagal and he did not have any more
occurrences.  Again, cards was consulted and they recommended
leaving the metoprolol dose the same at 25 mg tid, as bb
actually helps prevent vagal episodes.
.
# DVTs - while patient was in the ICU, he developed bilaterally
pedal edema, thought initially to be due to large amount of
IVFs.  Because of his new afib, though, we did ultrasounds and
found him to have DVTs in R leg, R arm (because he was edematous
and had pain around a new PICC line).  Heparin was started
overnight, but because of his hx of ICHs, it was decided to stop
the heparin and place an IVC filter.  It was put in place
without complications.  Evenutally he was found to have
bilaterally leg DVTs and then bilateral upper extremity DVTs.
At that point, it was decided that he should be anticoagulated.
Heparin was initially.  Repeat head CT showed no bleed.  And
then he was converted to lovenox for outpatient treatment of the
DVTs.  He also had a VQ scan during these findings of DVT that
showed low prob of PE.
.
# Access - pt initially had a subclavian line, then it was
pulled while the patient was febrile in early [**Month (only) 958**].  He had
PIVs until transfer to the ICU when a PICC line was placed.  The
PICC line was removed after a DVT was found in the arm.  He
again had PIVs for a while until a IR guided subclavian line was
placed.  For outpatient continuation of his 6 week course of
antibiotics, a hickman was placed as PICCs could not be placed
due to bilateraly UE DVTs.
.
# Pt was discharged walking around, passing PT and going up
stairs.  He respiratory status was much improved and he was not
on O2 and had no SOB.  He was advised not to start work yet and
take it easy, although, he was ready to get back to work as soon
as possible.

Discharge Condition:
vital signs stable, walking around, on lovenox, normal
neurological exam, afebrile


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you fell.  You were
found to have low blood counts and a bone marrow biospy showed
that you have leukemia.  You also had some small areas of
bleeding in your head that were stable based on repeat CT scans.
 You received chemotherapy for your leukemia.
.
While you were here, you developed an infection both in your
brain around the areas where the inital bleeds were found, as
well as in your thighs.  We treated you with antibiotics which
you will need to continue after going home.
.
You also developed blood clots in your arms and legs.  We place
a filter in your inferior vena cave (a large vein in your
abdomen) so the clots would not go to your lungs.  We also
anticoagulated you with heparin.  You can go home on lovenox to
stay anticoagulated.
.
Lastly, you developed a heart arrhythmia called atrial
fibrillation.  For that, you should continue taking the medicine
metoprolol.
.
You will have a home nurse help you and your wife do antibiotics
and the lovenox shots.  You should make sure to start returning
to work very slowly.  It is probably best to not work or work
from home the first week and see how you are feeling before
starting to think about going back to the school.  You can
discuss your progress with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] at your follow up
appointments.
.
You should return to the hospital for any fainting, headaches,
dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling in your
extremities, palpitiations or any other concerns.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 7 on Tuesday [**2183-5-13**]
at 1:30 pm.  Phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**].

Please follow up with infectious disease and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 y/o Spanish speaking female with h/o HTN, DM2, CAD s/p
4VCABG, hyperlipidemia, and asthma who presented to the ED with
hypotension, now resolved, a brief episode of chest pain, ruled
out, and abdominal pain, likely Gas/GERD.
.
1. Hypotension: the patient had nausea and vomiting prior to
admission and was found to be hypotensive at her PCP's office.
She was actually given lasix initially and started on dopamine
gtt. It is unclear from the note if she got fluid. The
hypotension was probably due to dehydration from vomiting the
week prior to admission. Dopamine gtt was weaned off and the
patient had no further issues with hypotension. She was
discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. Lasix dose was decreased
to 20 mg QD and her KCl was d/c'd because we halved her lasix
and her K on discharge was 5.1.
.
2. Renal Failure: Patient came in with a creatinine of 1.6 and
her baseline is unknown. Could be chronic renal failure from DM
that is giving her chronic renal insufficiency and perhaps she
was also prerenal from the vomiting prior to admission.
Creatinine steadily improved and is now 1.3 on discharge.
 .
3. Anemia: Crit on admission was 25. Likely ACD from DM. s/p
transfusion of 2 units in the CCU. HCT improving. Crit now 31.8.

.
4. DM2:bedtime sugar was 152, fasting this am 73 and at noon
118. We continued actos and avandia as well as a RISS and
patient was advised to take her home doses of lantus and regular
insulin at home.
.
5. HTN: Blood pressure was stable after dopamine gtt was
titrated off in the CCU. No issues of hypertension or
hypotension. Discharged patient on atenolol and lisinopril.
.
6. CAD: Patient denies chest pain. Lipid profile showed LDL 84,
HDL 54. We continued ASA, atenolol, lisinopril. No acute issues.
.
7. Asthma: no wheezing, stable sats. We gave the patient
albuterol PRN.

Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with history of ESRD on HD, DM, recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ORIF for left distal femur fracture (uncomplicated
hospital course) referred to ED today after she developed acute
change in mental status associated with decreased responsiveness
during a dialysis treatment today. History per daughter stated
that she last spoke to her mother night PTA and she was ""fine""
(asking her daughter about her finances, etc.). She denies that
her mother has ever had a seizure, stroke in the past. Denies
any baseline weakness or numbness. States the patient was living
on her own prior to her recent hip fracture.
.
Per sparse history on dialysis notes, patient was given percocet
at approximately 9:55AM and at approximately 10:30AM developed
acute mental status changes, including confusion. Patient
continued through dialysis with stable vital signs (BP
130's-140's/60's, HR 40's-50's). After completion of dialysis,
EMS was called for transfer to the hospital.
.
EMS notes were significant for noting ""rapid deterioration in
mental status"", right gaze, dry blood on lips, no response to
pain, aphasia. EMS noted decreased HR to 30's x 2 on transfer,
FSBS = 185.
.
On presentation to ED at [**Hospital1 18**], exam was notable for minimal
responsiveness, GCS 13, withdrawl of all extremities to pain,
following occasional commands, non-verbal (groans). VSS with T
98.8, HR 58, BP 132/102, O2 sat 98%. Labs were notable for WBC
9.5 with 86 N and 2 B, Cr 5.1 (hx ESRD on HD), AST 59, LDH 450,
AP 218, T bili 3.9, lactate 2.8. Blood cxs x 2 were sent in ED.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of intracranial bleed or edema.
CXR was wnl. MRI/A scan was performed (read pending). Evaluation
by neuro yielded diagnosis of possible seizure activity. Pt was
given narcan 0.4mg IV x 1, Ativan total of 2mg IV, dilantin load
(total of 2gm IV). She was intubated for airway protection
(given FFP prior to intubation as INR 1.9, on coumadin as outpt
as s/p hip surgery) and transferred to the ICU for further
managment.

Imaging:
[**2176-2-5**] CT head w/out contrast: No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or edema.
[**2176-2-5**] CXR: Unremarkable chest radiograph.
[**2176-2-5**] MRI brain w/out contrast [**2176-2-5**]: No evidence of acute
brain ischemia. Small arachnoid cyst in the right
cerebellopontine angle cistern. Limited MR angiography study-
the distal vasculature is poorly visualized, which could be
secondary to low cardiac output.
[**2176-2-6**] Liver U/S - Limited examination. Patent hepatic arteries
and veins and portal veins with flow in the appropriate
direction.
[**2176-2-7**] EEG - Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and

disorganized background and very frequent generalized sharp wave

discharges. These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy

affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications,

metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes. The sharp waves were prominent and frequent and suggest
an increased risk of seizures. Nevertheless, they were not
particularly rhythmic or of higher frequency during this
recording so as to suggest ongoing seizures at the time of the
recording. There were no prominent focal findings although
encephalopathies can obscure such findings. If concern for
seizures persist clinically, a repeat tracing could be of
assistance.
[**2176-2-8**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] - Severely limited study. No large gross changes
identified compared to [**2176-2-5**], but more subtle acute
changes will not be discernable on today's study. If indeed
there is high clinical suspicion of an acute change from [**2-5**], repeat imaging may be necessary.
[**2175-2-9**] Abdominal U/S - There is no ascites. Marked splenomegaly


Brief Hospital Course:
# Mental status change: Initial exam was notable for minimal
responsiveness, withdrawal of all extremities to pain, following
occasional commands, non-verbal (groans). VSS with T 98.8, HR
58, BP 132/102, O2 sat 98%. Head CT demonstrated no evidence of
intracranial bleed or edema. CXR was wnl. MRI/A scan was
performed and did not show any evidence of ischemia. Evaluation
by neuro yielded diagnosis of possible seizure activity. Pt was
given narcan 0.4mg IV x 1, Ativan total of 2mg IV, dilantin load
(total of 2gm IV). She was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to the ICU for further managment. She was also
covered for possible encephalitis/ meningitis with Acyclovir,
CTX, Vanco and Ampicillin. A LP was done but did not show any
signs of meningitis or encephalitis. The pt continued to have
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. She was found to have elevated
LFTs and was thought to have a component of hepatic
encephalopathy. First EEG supporting seizure activity. Repeat
EEG showed slowed activity c/w encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
encephalopathy: Ammonia elevated at 65, therefore pt has been
started on lactulose to attempt to improve MS. Repeat was in
30's. Abx were discontinued. On the [**2-8**] the pt self extubated
and was reintubated to be extubated on the [**2-9**]. A NG tube was
placed for nutrition. Over the following two days the pt was
more lucid and stable. She was called out to the floor for
further management. The pt continued to improve and became more
lucid and oriented x3.  Dilantin was continued orally at 300mg
QD. Free Dilantin levels were checked and below therapeutic
levels and therefore Dilantin was increased to 150 TID. Free
Dilantin level should be repeated in three days. Lactulose and
Rifaximin were continued. Lactulose should be titrated to three
bowel movements.
.
# Liver disease: Per pt's daughter the pt had tylenol induced
liver damage in past. Per daughter no ETOH/drug abuse in the
past. Hep A neg, B surface pos, core neg, Hep C neg. Serum IgG,
IgA, IgM were elevated without any specific pattern suggestive
of a disease process. [**Doctor First Name **] was negative, but Anti-SM and AMA were
mildly positive (Titer 1:20). HSV PCR was negative. Possible
primary biliary cirrhosis also consistent with obstructive
enzyme pattern. Also possible steatosis hepatis from obesity.
RUQ U/S showed splenomegaly, no ascites, no focal lesions in
liver, no sign of biliary dilatiation. Flow in appropriate
direction in portal vein. LFTs were followed up and were
trending down. Follow up of LFT, CBC and Chem 7 should be
obtained once in the following week. The pt has follow up
arranged for her with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on the [**2-13**] at
9.40am. A liver biopsy might be considered to investigate the
etiology of the problem further. The pt should be given
hepatitis A vaccine once she is more stable. She was adviced to
avoid hepatotoxic medications.
.
# Transient Leukocytosis and intermittent fever spike: Urine
with WBC, and one time positive urine culture for klebsiella. Pt
was initially treated for suspected meningitis with Ampicillin,
Vancomycin and Ceftraixone. Antiobiotics were discontinued five
days into her hospital course. The pt was afebrile after
discontinuation of the antibiotics and remained with a normal
WBC. The pt was found to have a new systolic murmur on exam,
radiating into her axilla, most consistent with a mild mitral
regurgitation. Follow up ECHO should be obtained. Given the fact
that all blood cultures were negative and the pt remained
afebrile and no other physical signs on examinations were found
consistent with endocarditis the suspicion for endocarditis was
considered low and no further workup was obtained.
.
# ESRD: Pt continued her outpatient dialysis schedule in house.
She tolerated dialysis well.
.
# Hypernatremia: transient. Due to lack of free water because of
to prolonged initial period without feeding as complicate NGT
placement. Free water deficit was calculated as about 4L. Pt was
repleted with free water boluses via NGT 250cc TID.
Hypernatremia resolved.
.
# Anemia - pt has baseline anemia - about three points decreased
from her baseline at around 29. Likely sequestration in spleen
and possible low grade hemolysis due to liver disease in
addition to renal anemia in ESRD. Hemolysis labs difficult to
interpret in the setting of liver disease. Iron studies
consistent with anemia of chronic disease, no iron deficiency.
Erythropoetin was administered during dialysis.
.
# Thrombocytopenia & elevated INR: HIT AB POSITIVE. Also with
splenomegaly and chronic liver disease, likely sequestering. All
heparin containing products were avoided. Thrombocytes were
consistently above 50,000.
.
# DM2: Endocrinology was consulted and sliding scale was
adjusted per recommendations. Lantus 20 and RISS to be continued
as outpatient. Pt had a one time episode of hypoglycemia to 49.
ISSC was decreased by unit two days prior to discharge. Further
fine adjustment should be achieved in the rehabilitation center.
.
# ORIF: pt was seen by orthopedics in house. Knee XR was
obtained. No dislocation of the hardware was seen. The pt should
remain not weight bearing on her L leg for 5 more weeks. F/u
appointment with ortho was obtained in 5 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 y/o female with chronic pain in low back and torticollis who
has been hospitalized for 7 previous medication overdoses who
presents s/p likely OD with minimal responsiveness. A brief
[**Hospital 11822**] hospital course is outlined below.

1. mental status changes/respiratory depression: Likely
secondary to medication effects from substance abuse/overdose.
Of note initial tox screen positive for benzos and methadone.
Remainder of tox screen was negative. She was given narcan
initially at max dose of 1mg/hr without increased
responsiveness. Therefore this was discontinued. Her mental
status gradually improved over the next 24 hours. Of note, she
did not need intubation for respiratory support and she had no
evidence for withdrawl signs or symptoms. She was kept on
diazepam 5mg q4prn for CIWA scale > 12, however did not require
any valium. CIWA scale was subsequently discontinued. All
further benzos or opioid analgesics were stopped.

2. Psych: Initially held all meds on admission. Neurontin,
lamictal, seroquel restarted upon improvement of MS.  Pt with
extensive psychiatric history including history of polysubstance
abuse and OD.  Psych consulted day after admission - recommended
1:1 sitter, which was obtained.  Also recommended holding off on
giving any benzos, other addictive substances - per psych,
unlikely for patient to withdraw because of long half life,
although kept on CIWA in case.  Now off CIWA. Discontinued
lamictal per psych recs. Increased seroquel dose for symptoms of
anxiety. Plan for section 35 for patient to mandatorily receive
drug rehab.

Cardiac cath:1. Coronary and grft angiography showed a previous
right
dominant system. The LMCA was diffusely disesed with no focal or

critical lesions. The LAD tapered off in the mid segment until a
large
S2 where it is totally occluded. The D1 and D2 are small vessels
and
are diffusely diseased. The D3 which recived a SVG  is not seen
in the
LMCA injection. The Mid and the distal LAD receives the LIMA.
The Cx
vessel it self has no lesions. It gives a lengthy collateral.
The OM1
arises close to the LMCA and is small. The OM2 too arises close
to the
LMCA and is large. This has a proximal lesion of 80%. The OM3
recives the SVG and is not seen on LMCA injection. The
OM4/postero
latateral branch arises distally and is a small vessel. The RCA
is
occluded proximally. The distal RCA including the PDA and the
PLV are
collateralised by the left system. The PDA is poorly filled and
has a
mid 60% lesion. The LIMA , the LIMA-LAD anastomosis and the
distal LAD
are free of disease. The LIMA fills the LAD retrogradely to
supply the
proximal LAD and the D3. The D3 has an ostial 70% lesion with
TIMI III
flow. The SV grafts to the RCA and the PLB are occluded
completely and
are seen as stumps in the aorta. The graft to the Diagonal could
not be
located, but is likely to be occluded given the other
angiogaphic
findings. The SVG to the OM3 shows diffuse disease with a mid
lengthy
lesion of 99 % and the whole vessel showed TIMI II flow. There
were no
collaterals for this OM.
2. Left ventriculography was not performed.
3. Predilation using 1.5 X 15 Maverick balloon, stenting using
3.0 X 28
and 3.0 X 33 OTW Cypher stents and thrombus extraction using
export
catheter with gradual deterioration of flow of the SVG to the
OM3. The
flow deteriorated from TIMI I to TIMI 0.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with functioning
LIMA to
the LAD.
2. Acute occlusion of the SVG to the OM and chronically occluded
SV
grafts to the PDA, PLB and Diagonal.
3. Unable to restore flow in the SVG to the OM despite stenting,

pharmacotherapy and thrombus aspiration. .
Echo: . The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Basal inferior
hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ct scan:
1. No evidence of intrahepatic gas as suggested on prior
ultrasound. Repeat ultrasound is suggested given this change in
appearance.
2. Bibasilar dependent atelectatic changes/consolidation with
associated effusions.
3. Gas distended loops of bowel with air-fluid levels but
without transition suggesting ileus. Stool distended rectum.
4. Small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted with unstable angina, had total occlusion of all
svg grafts with a patent LIMA to LAD, and received 2 cypher
stents.  His catheterization was compicted by failed thrombus
extractuib abd a TIMI 0.  After catherization he had persistent
CP and evidence of a NSTEMI.  Initially he was not treated with
ASA because of a past GI bleed, but with persistent ischemia, it
was added to the plavix.  He required a significant of morphine
to controll his pain.  Through discussions between the MICU team
and the family pain control was determined to be the only option
for him.  His code status was changed to DNR/DNI/.  Due to
ongoing ischemia, he had persistent hypotension that required
multiple pressors.  His HD was changed to CVVH because of his
low blood presssure.  He also had intermittent NSVT.  He had
been transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team to the MICU team due to
hypotension at HD after his cardiac catheterization out of
concern for possible sepsis.  There was a concern that he had an
acute abdomen but he appeared to be impacted with stool.  He was
disimpacted and received an aggresive bowel regimen.  His
distension and pain improved.  He had low grade temperatures and
was initially treated for pneumonia because he was hypoxic.  No
source of infection was identified.  It is more likely that he
was in cardiogenic shock with fluid overload.  A repeat bedside
echo did not reveal worsening ventricular function.  He required
blood transfusions for persistently dropping HCT in the setting
of very frequent blood draws.  He also had a coagulopathy which
did not appear to be from DIC.  He required vitamin K
supplementation.  He expired at 6:45am on [**2108-10-5**] after an
episode of severe chest pain.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 32612**]
Chief Complaint:
Painless jaundice.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-4-4**]:
-Diagnostic laparoscopy.
-Peritoneal washings and cytology
-Exploratory laparotomy.
-Cholecystectomy.
-Harvest of pedicled omental flap for protection of anastomoses.
-Pancreaticoduodenectomy with standard gastrojejunostomy,
antecolic.
- Right hepatic artery reconstruction using right gonadal vein
interposition graft (performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).

History of Present Illness:
71F presented with painless jaundice, dark urine, bloating, and
anorexia. She first noticed the onset of symptoms in [**Month (only) **] or
[**Month (only) 1096**] and then was alerted by a friend to her increasing
jaundice, which prompted medical evaluation. At [**Hospital3 3583**],
her labs were as follows: total bilirubin 28, Alk phos 338, ALT
128 prior to arrival. She underwent an ultrasound and a CT with
contrast and was found to have a 2.4 x 1.8 cm mass with a cystic
structre in the head of the pancreas, distended and thickened
gallbladder, intrahepatic (1.9 cm)and pancreatic duct (1.2 cm).
At the time of consultation she was clinically well and denies
nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She underwent ERCP
which revealed a single irregular stricture of malignant
appearance that was 2 cm long at the lower third of the common
bile duct. There was severe post-obstructive dilation. A limited
pancreatogram revealed a stricture of the main duct at the head.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful. Contrast medium
was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A
sphincterotomy was performed. A 7cm by 10FR biliary stent was
placed. Cytology samples were obtained for histology which
returned positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient was offered a
Whipple operation, with the following explained: a 1-2% risk of
death, a 30-40% risk of complication. From her OSH scan report,
she had no involvement of the mesenteric vessels and no evidence
of metastatic disease, although there is periportal
lymphadenopathy. She understood the risks/benefits of the
surgery, and decided to proceed with the operation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2108-4-4**] for
Whipple procedure, necessitating right hepatic artery
reconstruction with gonadal vein for which the vascular surgery
service was consulted intraoperatively. Reader referred to both
operative notes for full details. She received 6 u pRBC, 2 FFP,
and 500 of albumin in the OR, and was left intubated on
pressors, and taken to the surgical ICU post operatively. Her
course thereafter in the ICU was complicated. In brief: she
required frequent blood transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and albumin,
with a persistent pressor requirement; she developed acute renal
failure requiring CVVH, had persistent elevations of LFTs, had a
persistent leukocytosis and in total the cardiology, infectious
disease, renal, and hepatology services were consulted.
Significant events by post-operative day included: On POD2 the
renal service was consulted given persistent renal failure
postoperatively, and she was begun on CVVH. Given down-trending
platelets, HIT panel was sent and returned positive on POD5, and
the patient was begun on a bivalirudin drip per hematology
recommendations. On POD6 TF were initiated via NGT, her foley
was removed, and sputum cultures revealed GNR for which she was
begun on vancomycin/ciprofloxacin/flagyl. Antibiotics were
thereafter tailored appropriately in consultation with the
infectious disease service. On POD8 a left brachial vein clot
was found on non-invasives and she was initiated on
fondaparinux, subsequently discontinued. On POD11 the patient
was noted to have QTC prolongation, for which the cardiology
service was consulted, and recommendations were followed
regarding medication adjustments. On [**2108-4-17**]  the patient was
extubated, and briefly off pressors. She was found to have SBP,
and begun on meropenem in consultation with the hepatology and
ID services. Lactulose was initiated given poor mental status
(AOx1 initially), on which she seemed to initially improve. On
POD20 the patient failed a speech and swallow evaluation, and
continued on tube feedings. Her pressor requirement remained
persistent, and her WBC continued to trend upwards. On [**2108-5-4**],
in discussion with the patient's HCP, she was made DNR/DNI. On
the evening of [**2108-5-7**] she was noted to be hypothermic to 89,
was in DIC per labarotory values and she passed away on [**2108-5-8**],
post-operative day 34.

History of Present Illness:
70 year old man with afib on coumadin, insulin dependent DM,
obseity, systolic and diastolic heart failure LVEF 40-45%, CAD
s/p CABG '[**93**], PTCA'[**15**], STEMI with BMS to the SVG-OM graft
[**2118-4-8**], presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion over past
week.  He was initially feeling well after discharge [**3-/2117**] and
began exercising and losing weight.  However, this past week
dyspnea increased and exertional capacity decreased.  He called
his cardiologist who thought he might be overdiuresed, therefore
his lasix and spironolactone were reduced to half prior doses.
Dyspnea worsened despite this change.  Then on the day of
admission he had 2 bowel movements, the second of which was dark
black.  The bowel movement was preceeded by crampy abdominal
pain.  He attempted to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen but
because acutely dyspneic.  He sat down and then developed chest
pain, took a nitro with relief.  Tried to walk again but the
chest pain returned, thus called EMS and was brought to an OSH.
There his chest pain was relieved by repeated nitroglycerin and
he was eventually started on a nitroglycerin drip.  Labs at OSH
were notable for HCT 25, INR 3.7, K 7.  Enroute to [**Hospital1 18**], his
SBP dropped with increasing nitro drip doses.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was chest pain free with VS 97.6
99/56, 74 16 97% 2L.  ECG showed a new LBBB, trop negative.
Labs notable for K 7.2 (not hemolyzed) and thus he received
calcium, D50/insulin, and kayexalate.  INR was 4.9.  GI was
called given HCT drop from 31 to 25 and made plans to scope in
the morning.  Rectal exam notable for brown stool guaiac
positive with specks of black stool.  Nitroglycerin drip was
stopped and his pain was controlled with morphine PRN.  He
received 1L NS.  Vitals prior to transfer 98.1 69 109/41 16 99%
RA pain 0.

On arrival to the MICU, he was initially comfortable, but then
developed chest pain prompting morphine 2mg x3 without relief.
SL nitro was given with improvement in pain.  ECG showed narrow
complex sinus rhythm with ST depressions in I, V4-V6.  He later
had another episode of pain relieved by SL nitroglycerin.

Colonoscopy [**2118-5-18**]:
Impression:
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old man with afib on coumadin, insulin dependent DM,
obseity, systolic and diastolic heart failure LVEF 40-45%, CAD
s/p CABG '[**93**], PTCA'[**15**], STEMI with BMS to the SVG-OM graft
[**2118-4-8**], presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, found to
have hematocrit drop secondary to GI bleed.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
=================
# Chest Pain: Demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed. He has
known coronary vascular disease with refractory angina that is
not amenable to intervention per cardiology team. No evidence of
consolidation or PTX on CXR to suggest pulmonary cause. Patient
was transfused a total of 8 units pRBCs; hematocrit initially
stabilized and when heparin gtt and coumadin were re-started,
hematocrit dropped again and chest pain returned without EKG
changes. He was continued on aspirin, plavix, and ranolazine.
Imdur was started at a lower dose than home dose given concern
for hypotension in setting of bleeding, but BP remained stable
so imdur was titrated up to his home dose. He then had return of
chest pain, with dynamic ST changes in V3-V5 and I/avL,
consistent with known non-intervenable areas of disease.  His
imdur was increased to 240mg and metoprolol was increased to
tartrate 150mg PO BID without further episodes of chest pain.

# UGIB/H.Pylori + Nodular Gastritis: On EGD, patient had
evidence of nodular gastritis with superficial erosions.
H.pylori returned positive and patient began triple therapy with
amoxicillin (not candidate for clarithromycin given interaction
with ranolazine), metronidazole and pantoprazole.  Coumadin was
held and INR was reversed with vitamin K.  Patient had ongoing
hematocrit drop without obvious bleeding once heparin drip was
restarted, so both coumadin and heparin were stopped.  Patient
will complete 2 weeks of triple therapy, then continue [**Hospital1 **]
pantoprazole.  He does not require GI follow-up or test of cure.
He also underwent colonoscopy which did not reveal an additional
or alternative source of his bleeding. If he continues to bleed,
the next step would be a capsule endoscopy. He will have a [**Hospital1 **]
check prior to his PCP appointment to assess his hematocrit.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Source suspected to be gastritis as
above. Coumadin was held on admission to the ICU and reversed
with vitamin K and FFP.  He was transfused a total of 8 units
during admission; initially 4 units in the ICU as he had an
inappropriate response to blood, then again on the floor as with
initiation of coumadin and bridge with heparin drip, patient's
hematocrit drifted down.  Haptoglobin and LDH were normal, and
indirect bilirubin was only slightly elevated (and was post
transfusion) so low suspicion for hemolysis.  With
discontinuation of heparin drip and coumadin, hematocrit
stabilized and patient did not require transfusion for >72 hours
prior to discharge.

# Constipation: Significantly constipated during admission.
Required 2 days of prep prior to his colonoscopy.  Patient
discharged on senna/colace/miralax to prevent further
constipation.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  On admission,
patient had mild pulmonary edema secondary to decreased lasix
and spironolactone dose over past week prior to admission.
Patient was diuresed in the ICU, and was euvolemic on transfer
to the floor. He was continued on home lasix 40mg daily, with
extra doses with transfusions. He had a few episodes of
orthostatic hypotension prompting decrease of his lasix dose to
20mg PO daily. Patient was euvolemic at the time of discharge,
and weight was stable at 120 kg.

# Hyperkalemia: 7.2 on admission likely secondary to ARF,
spironolactone, and lisinopril.  ECG improved to narrow complex
once potassium normalized. Potassium remained stable for
remainder of admission.  Spironolactone was not restarted, and
lisinopril was restarted at lower dose of 5mg PO daily.

# LBBB: Suspect metabolic etiology given improved with K
correction.  Trop negative suggesting against acute coronary
syndrome.  LBBB resolved after correction of K.

# Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to systolic CHF with
poor forward flow with second hit of poor perfusion due to acute
GIB. Patient's creatinine trended down and was 1.1 on day of
discharge.

# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, but may be due to stress of
GIB.  No evidence of infectious colitis, UA without evidence of
infection and no consolidation seen on CXR.  White count
resolved and remained normal for remainder of admission.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
==================

# HLD: continued atorvastatin

# Depression: continued venlafaxine

# DMII: Blood sugar well controlled during admission.

Transitional issues:
# Spironolactone held on discharge given hyperkalemia to 7.2 on
admission.

# Coumadin held on discharge -> we anticipate holding this
medication for about a month while his gastritis heals with
protection against stroke with aspirin 325mg and plavix 75mg in
the interim.

# Lisinopril decreased to 5mg daily to prevent hyperkalemia and
increase pressure room to uptitrate Imdur to 240mg PO daily and
metoprolol to 150mg tartrate [**Hospital1 **]

# H.pylori triple therapy treatment to continue through [**2118-5-23**]

# Hematocrit and electrolytes should be rechecked by PCP at
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] appointment, he has a script for this.

# Insulin decreased to 70/30 mix 80 units daily given in-house
hypoglycemia. We suggest setting him up with [**Last Name (un) **] for further
diabetes management but wanted him to discuss this with his PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].

daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you! You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation and treatment of chest pain, shortness of breath,
and GI bleeding. You were found to have a low blood count likely
due to a slow bleed in your GI tract related to all of your
blood thinners and gastritis with erosions from H. pylori (a
bacteria that pre-disposes to gastritis and ulcers).  You were
started on a medication to protect your GI tract, treatment for
your infection, and you were given blood transfusions to improve
your blood counts. You underwent an upper endoscopy which showed
the inflammation of the stomach and erosions and a colonoscopy
which was without source of bleeding.

You also had an elevation in your potassium level, so your
spironolactone was discontinued.

We attempted re-starting anticoagulation but you began to bleed
again. As a result, your coumadin is being held until resolution
of your gastritis. We suggesting waiting a month or so until
resuming coumadin and would like to re-assure you that you are
recieving protection against stroke from your afib from your
aspirin and plavix.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
- START Metronidazole three times day through Monday [**2118-5-23**] to treat the infection in your stomach
- START Amoxicillin twice a day through Monday [**2118-5-23**] to
treat the infection in your stomach
- INCREASE pantoprazole to twice a day to protect your stomach
lining
- INCREASE Imdur to 240mg by mouth daily
- CHANGE to Metoprolol Tartrate 150mg by mouth twice daily
- DECREASE Lisinopril to 5mg daily
- DECREASE Lasix to 20mg daily
- DECREASE Insulin 70/30 to 80 units twice daily
- STOP Spironolactone
- STOP Coumadin -> you will have to discuss with your primary
care doctor restarting this medication about a month from now
once your gastritis has healed
- START Senna and Colace twice a day as needed for constipation
- START Miralax once daily as needed for constipation

Please follow up as suggested below.

History of Present Illness:
60 y/o M w/alcohol abuse, HTN, who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
on Saturday [**4-27**] c/o severe abd pain, n/v. Had started 2 days
prior in setting of binge drinking with whiskey. Pain was
epigastric radiating to his back. He was found to have a lipase
of >3000. and was admitted to their medical service for acute
pancreatitis. He was kept NPO and given IVF. He also was given
Levaquin for ""lethargy"" and an infiltrate on CXR. The next day,
[**4-28**], his bilirubin increased (0.8-2.6) and he continued to have
severe abd pain, so he was changed from levaquin to primaxin,
and he was trnasferred to their ICU. He was put on a lasix [**Hospital1 **]
due to rales and cardiomegaly, and kept on NS at 100 cc/hr. He
had a CT scan with po and IV contrast that showed acute
pancreatitis with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; multiple
hypodense irregular lesions in the right lobe of the liver,
thickened GB wall with pericholecystic fluid, and a 5x4 cm
hypodense collection in the RLQ adjacent to the psoas muscle.
.
On [**4-29**], he was supposed to go to MRCP but was claustrophobic
and required ativan. After this, he felt better but required
more ativan while in Radiology. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes, his heart rate was
""sporadic"" from the 40s to the 160s. He was given more ativan
and then his HR dropped to the 20s (bp 145/63 at this time). He
then became diaphoretic, c/o chest pain, and the MRCP was
stopped. He was transferred to the stretcher and then turned
[**Doctor Last Name 352**], ""started to seize"" and was noted to be pulseless. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN
note, he was asystolic but per d/c summary and cardiology
consult note, it was VT/VF. He received ""several"" shocks and CPR
as well as one bolus dose of amiodarone. He was intubated during
the code. He regained a pulse after an unknown amt of time. He
became hypotensive requiring dopamine. He was then seen by Renal
due to worsening renal failure (creatinine 0.8 on admission to
3.5 on d/c) who felt this was likely pre-renal failure from
volume depletion plus contrast from the CT. His MRCP was read as
showing small ascites, peripancreatic stranding, pericholecystic
fluid, and a large gallstone. CBD did not appear dilated but the
images were quite limited; no obvious intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Complex T2
hyperintesnsity along right psoas muscle as seen by CT measuring
5.2 x3.7 cm, representing a complex fluid collection. He was
transferred here for further management.

Imaging:
[**2143-4-30**]: Abd u/s -
1. Minimal ascites in right upper and right lower quadrants.
2. Gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder with edema of the
gallbladder wall. This could reflect acute cholecystitis but
also could be a manifestation of changes due to the patient's
known acute pancreatitis.
3. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
4. Patent portal vein.
.
[**2143-5-3**]: Head CT -
Diffuse hypodensity and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation
suggesting global hypoxia and infarction. However, a similar
appearance could be caused by severe acute hepatic or renal
failure.
Subacute left parietal infarction without hemorrhage.
Possible small right parietal subacute infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 60 year old man  with history of
alcohol abuse, admitted to an OSH with severe acute
pancreatitis/pseudocyst, complicated by cardiac arrest, and ARDS
transferred for further management. The patient was treated in
the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for approximately two weeks without recovery of
neurologic function. During that time, he was treated for ARDS,
severe pancreatitis, acute renal failure (with CVVHD and then
HD), anemia, and altered mental status. The patient remained
unresponsive after weaning sedation, and the patient's family
agreed that he should be made comfort measures only given that
his severely depressed mental status was due to anoxic brain
injury. This conclusion was established with the aid of
Neurology consultants. At that time, the patient was transferred
out of ICJ to the general medicine floor. He passed away on [**5-12**], [**2142**].

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an 85 year old gentleman with a
history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure and
recent medically treated cholecystitis who presented with
recurrent cholecystitis that was treated with percutaneous
drainage and antibiotics.  His hospital course was complicated
by delirium and mild pulmonary edema.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] presented with right upper
quadrant pain and nausea and fatigue. Labs significant for
normal LFTs. RUQ ultrasound demonstrate dacute cholecystitis.
Suurgery was consulted and recommended percutaneous drainage of
his gallbladder which was carried out by IR. Initial pus was
drained from the gallbladder which transioned to bilious
drainage on Day # 2 of admission. He was covered with Vancomycin
and Zosyn initially. Culture data from the biliary drain grew
ecoli sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic therapy was changed
to ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to include anaerobic coverage
for a total of 14 days.  His biliary drain was kept in place
with plan for discontinuation by general surgery in [**5-25**] weeks.
He was afebrile for the duration of his hospital course.
.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: On admission he was noted be dyspneic.
An initial chest xray was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia that could not be ruled out in the setting of
pulmonary edema. He was initially on vancomycin and zosyn on
admission to the intensive care unit.  While diuresis was
initially held on secondary to concern for acute kidney injury
his pulmonary edema accumulated during his initial hospital
days.  He was given IV lasix 20mg twice and restarted on his
home dose of lasix 20mg daily.  This dose was uptitrated to 40mg
daily which appeared to better control his volume status and
improved his breathing. An echo demonstrated symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilation and global systolic
dysfunction suggestive of a non-ischemic pattern with EF 25%. A
low dose ace-inhibitor (lisinopril 5mg) was started and he was
continued on an aspirin and beta blocker. He reported no cough
and was afebrile for the duration of hospitalization.  A repeat
chest xray after diuresis revealed no evidence of pneumonia. His
nighttime oxygen saturations were noted to be stably in the low
90s.
.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: A urine sample from admission was
concerning for infection and culture grew ecoli sensitive to
ciprofloxacin. A repeat UA prior to discharge was clear of
infection.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] is rate controlled with metoprolol
and anticoagulated with aspirin given fall risk.  He was noted
to have heart rates in the 110s with frequent episodes of non
sustained ventricular tachycardia, therfore his metoprolol was
incrased to 50mg three times a day with improvement in the
frequency of NSVT and heart rates in the 60-70s during the day.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed with management changes.
There was a question of whether he was on domperidone in the
past. It was taken off his medication list.
.
DELIRIUM: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] was noted to have progressive delirium
throughout his hospitalization which was improving prior to
discharge. No pharmacologic agents were required for management.
He had an attentive family at his bedside at all his times.
Repeat infectious work-up including UA, chest xray and cdiff
toxin were negative for infection. His electrolytes were stable.
 Etiology attributed to age, dementia and hospitalization
including ICU stay.
.
SPEECH AND SWALLOW: While delirius, Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] was noted to have
small aspiration events with eating and drinking. A speech and
swallow evaluation recommended nectar thickened liquids with
suggested re-evaluation when his delirium clears.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: His renal function ranged between 1.8
and 2.0 throughout his hospitalization which was just above his
baseline.
.
HYPERTENSION:  Well controlled. Furosemide increased to 40mg PO.
 Amlodipine was discontined in favor of lisinopril 5mg.
Hydralazine was held on discharge given normotensive. He should
discuss restarting this medication with his primary care
physician after discharge.
.
HYPOTHYROID: He was continued on levothyroxine.
.
VITAMIN D:  He was continued on vitamin D.
.
DYSLIPIDEMIA: He was continued on crestor 20mg daily.
.
DEPRESSION: He was continued on wellbutrin 300mg daily.
.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY: He was continued on flomax.
.
PAIN: Secondary to frequent falls. He was continued on tylenol
and gabapentin.
.
INSOMNIA: Lunesta was held on admission and should be
reconsidered on discharge.
.
GERD: He was continued on ranitidine and nexium.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 8 additional days
- Primary care follow-up, Electrolytes should be checked within
1 week as she has started lasix and lisinopril.

Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65 y.o. female with PMHx of COPD, esophageal stricture s/p
dilatation in [**Month (only) 404**] who presents with a chief complaint of
falls. Patient reports a long history of falls, with 1 fall each
day for the past 3 consecutive days. She reports some dizziness
occasionally prior to these falls, but otherwise denies prodrome
of chest pain, SOB, palpitations. She reports hitting her head
with her falls, but denies LOC. She also recently fell on her
right chest and has had subsequent pain. She attributes her
falls to decreased vision (has a history of cataracts s/p two
surgeries on the right, many years ago) and is also supposed to
ambulate with a walker, but doesn't always comply. She also
wears 2 liters of oxygen at baseline and has noted that she
occasionally trips over her oyxgen tubing while trying to
ambulate. She thus primarily comes in with a complaint of falls,
but noted a cough productive of yellow/brown sputum for the past
2 months with subjective fevers (sweats) for which she was
further evaluated. She reports her grandchildren as well as a
gentleman in her building as potential sick contacts, but
otherwise denies any recent travel or exposures. She does report
getting her flu shot last year and receiving her pneumovax 2
years ago.
.
In the ED, patient was noted to be tachycardic to the 120s and
hypoxic to 89% on RA. This improved to 96% on NRB after a failed
attempt with nasal cannula. Patient was also noted to have a
lactate of 3.3 and a leukocytosis to 22.8 with a bandemia of 9%.
CXR showed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates, concerning
for PNA and given hypoxia, lactic acidosis and leukocytosis,
patient was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone. Otherwise,
patient was noted to have acute renal failure from 0.6 to 1.3
and she was given 1 L of NS. Additionally, potassium of 2.4 was
repleted. EKG was performed which was unremarkable, but troponin
x 1 was elevated to 0.05 in the setting of ARF and ASA was
given. Patient was asymptomatic otherwise. Lastly, given history
of recent falls, CT neck and head were performed without
evidence of fracture or bleed. Patient was subsequently admitted
to the ICU for further management of probable pneumonia with
significant hypoxia and bandemia.
.
Upon arrival in the ICU, patient was on NRB, speaking in full
sentences, not in acute distress. She complained of right sided
chest pain due to her fall and also endorsed dysuria and
hematuria. Otherwise, she had no complaints.

Imaging/studies:
.
CXR on admission:
.
FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
There is patchy consolidation in the right mid and lower lung,
concerning for right middle and lower lobe pneumonia. The left
lung appears essentially clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. There
is no
pneumothorax. Bony structures appear intact.
.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for right middle and lower lobe
pneumonia.
.
ECG on admission: Sinus tachycardia, rate 118. Low voltage in
the standard leads. Left atrial abnormality. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2165-8-28**] sinus tachycardia is new as is
borderline first degree A-V block.
.
CT head on admission:
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or acute
large vascular territory infarction. There is extensive
periventricular white
matter hypodensity, consistent with sequelae of small vessel
ischemic disease.
There is mild prominence of sulci and ventricles, likely
secondary to global
parenchymal atrophy. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. The
basilar cisterns are preserved. Osseous structures and
surrounding soft
tissues, including the globes and orbits, are unremarkable. The
left lens
appears prosthetic. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells
are normally pneumatized and clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Global parenchymal atrophy and sequelae of small vessel
ischemic disease.
2. No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular
territory
infarction.
.
CT neck on admission:
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Mild multifocal cervical spondylosis with no evidence for
canal stenosis.
3. Biapical pleural scarring.
.
CT chest [**5-1**]:
.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings most consistent with multifocal pneumonia without
evidence of
cavitation. Partial right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis
and small
bilateral pleural effusions.

2. Boarderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive
in nature.

3. 2.6-cm benign-appearing left adrenal lesion.
.
CXR [**5-2**] -
.
Since yesterday, right mid and lower lung opacity increased.
Left upper and
mid lung opacity also increased, very worrisome for rapidly
progressing
multifocal pneumonia, could be Legionella. Small left pleural
effusion also
increased. Tiny right pleural effusion is unchanged. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise normal
.
ECHO [**2166-5-5**]:
.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.
.
CXR [**5-5**]: IMPRESSION: Right upper and right middle lobe
pneumonia, not significantly
changed. Small right pleural effusion.
.
CT chest [**2166-5-6**]
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Consolidation in the left lung has almost completely
resolved.
2. Consolidations in the right middle lobe and right upper lobe
with new
areas of cavitation are present.
3. Unchanged left adrenal lesion.
4. Persistent slight decreased small effusions, greater on the
right side.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y.o. female with PMHx significant for COPD and esophageal
stricture, s/p dilatation in [**Month (only) 404**] who presents with
multifocal Streptococcal PNA, sepsis.
.
Brief ICU course:
.
She was diagnosed w/ PNA via CT and w/ S. pneumococcal
bacteremia ([**2-19**] BCx [**4-30**]).  She was started on IV CFTX and
Levaquine.  Her BCx had been negative since starting CFTx and
Levofloxacin, but she had a persistent WBC count and low grade
fevers.  She was treated w/ ABx as above, and her last fever was
noted on [**5-1**] of 101F prior to transfer to the floor, but she
has had low grade 100 fevers since admission.  Her oxygen
requirement improved to 4L NC and her RR decreased to 18-22.
Pt. was also noted to have a microcytic anemia of unclear
etiology, with nadir HCT of 18, transfused 2 U prbcs and has
since been HD stable w/ HCT in mid 20s. Finally, patient has
been tachycardic in 100s - 110s, in sinus rhythm. This was felt
to be due to sepsis.  She was transferred to the medical floor
on for further management.
.
Her course was complicated by worsening WBC and fever while on
the medical floor with RML consolidation developing cavitations,
and multiple loose stools.  Please see below for detailed
discussion of each of the problems.
.
# PNA and S.Pneumo Sepsis. Infiltrates were felt to be due to
CAP with resultant bacteremia (strep pneumo). Pt. had persistent
leukocytosis.  There was no  aspiration noted with Video
swallow, however she was noted to have penetration of thin
liquids.  She was continued on CFTX on the floor. However, on
[**5-6**], developed Fever, and increasing O2 requirement.  She was
again pancultured and a CT was repeated showing improved L
consolidation, slight improvement on the right but new air
loculations.  Due to concern for empyema (staph or strep), her
ABx regimen was broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn for treatment
of HAP and Aspiration PNA.  Patient remained HD stable.  Due to
wheezing on exam, she was started on standing ipratropium and
albuterol nebulizers.  With this treatment, her WBC continued to
improve, and her O2 requirement resolved.  She had an an episode
of fever on [**5-6**] to 101.3F.  CT chest was obtained and showed
improved infiltrate on L and R, but newe air loculation.  She
was broadened to Vanco/Zosyn for one day but defervesced prior
to these ABx being administered.  Pulmonary team was consulted
regardging bronchoscopy, and it was decided that in face of
clinical improvement and likelyhood of the cavitation being [**1-20**]
Strep Pneumo and/or anaerobes (too short of a course for Staph
to have developed cavitation in < 24hrs if VAP).  She was
switched to Cefpodoxime PO and Flagyl PO for 2 weeks (day 1 =
[**5-8**], pt had already received 7 days of either CFTX/Levofloxacin
or Vanc/Zosyn) for a total course of 3 weeks.  She will require
a follow up CXR by end for 2 weeks (last day [**2166-5-22**]).   PCP
follow up is arranged for [**5-19**].  Please fax this summary and any
rehab course notes to PCPs office prior to discharge.  She will
require weaning of nebulizers and restarting of home advair and
starting of tiotropium for her COPD.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Likely reactive from pulmonary infection vs.
C.diff. as patient with loose stools and was on ABx > 5d prior
to onset of diarrhea.  Given high grade bacteremia and new
murmur, TTE was obtained and did not show vegetations.  Her
first C.Diff was negative but she was tx empiricaly with PO
Vanco given persistently loose stools and Age > 65.  Her UA/UCx
were negative.  C.Diff retunred negative x3 and PO vanco was
discontinued [**5-8**] after 2 days of tx.  She was started on Flagyl
as above. She remained afebrile since [**5-5**] and her WBC was 11 on
day of discharge.  She had persistent [**Last Name (un) 940**] stools, but of lower
frequency, 5 -> 3/day.
.
# Anemia, microcytic.  Hct at baseline, 29-30. Currently HCT
23-25, same as on admission s/p 2U PRBCs. Pt. has hx of iron
deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**]. Previously was on
iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy in our
system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed, last EGD was
unremarkable. Guaiac negative in the ED. There were no signs of
hemolysis.  Anemia was felt to be multifactorial (ACD, Fe
defficiency).  Per discussio w/ PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Doctor First Name 111639**], she
was reported to have had a colonoscopy  that revealed 12 cm of
colitis, showing acute on chronic inflammation, with ? of
chronic ischemia.  Her HCT upon discharge was 25 and stable.
She will require a repeat outpatient colonoscopy and endoscopy.

.
# Elevated Troponin: In the setting of renal failure with normal
EKG and asymptomatic. Troponins trended down, and there were no
CK elevations. Likely due to demand. No signs of HF, EF > 60%,
no WMA. She was continued on ASA 81mg.
.
# PTST/Depression:  Contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's outpatient provider and
confirmed diagnoses of PTSD and Depression.  Patient has been
actively obtaining treatment as OP prior to admission.  She had
two episodes of emotional lability and crying spells.  Her
attention was impaired (felt to be due to delerium in setting of
infection).  Patient probably had underlying dementia (global
parenchymal atrophy and periventricular white matter disease on
CT head), however this could not be evaluated in setting of
delirium.  She was continued on Celexa, Quetiapine and
Duloxetine at home doses.  Her ativan was temporarily held due
to delerium but was restarted at 2mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her home dose is 2mg
[**Hospital1 **] and 4mg QHS, which can be restarted prn as pt is remains
stable.
.
# S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision,
non-compliance with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing
tripping and likely acutely worsened in the setting of impending
infection prior to admission.  CT head and c-spine without
bleeding or fractures. Per PT will require acute level
rehabilitation.
.
# Poor nutritional status. Pt. denies poor PO intake, but
Albumin is 2.4. Noted to have poor PO intake by nursing staff in
CCU. Has hx of esophageal stricture. Was started on Ensure
supplementation TID.
.
# Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
.
# Communication: Patient is currently at odds with her children
and would prefer that communication be done with her SW - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 51796**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111640**] at [**Street Address(2) 111641**] in [**Location 17065**]. She is in counseling
with this SW and reports a history of domestic violence in the
past. She currently feels safe now. She has only allowed staff
to speak with her son.  Finally, Pt reports she is in the
process of being evicted, and states she does not want her
family to know. She said case manager at Elder Services has been
helping to deal with eviction problem, and consented to this SW
calling her (Anjale [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 111642**] [**Hospital1 8**] [**Hospital1 3494**] Elder Services

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Upper GI bleed: Patient was on coumadin for recent hx of PE
and received 4 units of FFP and vit K in the EW to correct his
INR.  Coumadin was held intinitally for possible active bleed.
GI was consulted and EGD was done on [**2165-8-2**] which showed an
ulcer in the distal esophagus with active bleeding from that
site.  Successful clipping of the vessel was achieved using a
Resolution Endoclip device and then injected with epinephrine
for hemostasis.  Patient received total of 3 units of PRBC.
Patient was continued on PPI for prophylaxis and serial
hematocrit was done which remained stable (Hct>30).

2)Neuro: Patient has a hx of intracranial bleed s/p basilar
stent.  Patient on Plavix and [**Date Range **] for post-stent prophylaxis.
Patient remained lethargic which is his baseline.  He was able
to follow simple commands at times, moving his hands and feet
and occasionally giving verbal response.  Per family member,
patient appears to be more alert than before.  Neurosurgery
following this patient and strongly urged to hold Coumadin for
the risk of re-bleeding intracranially.  After discussion with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] from neurosurgery, it was decided to discharge patient
with Lovenox.

3)A-fib: During EGD proceduse, clipping of the bleeding vessel
was done and epinephrine was injected to that site.  Right after
the epinephrine was injected, he went into rapid afib to 150's
with ST depressions.  He was given a total of 10 mg of lopressor
with some decrease in his HR to the 120's-130's.  After 10 mg of
IV diltiazem, his HR came down to the 90's-100's and his BP
dropped to the 80's briefly.  MI was ruled out with serial
cardiac enzymes and he was given 25 mg of lopressor.  Patient
remained on sinus tachycardia, and lopressor was titrated up to
50 mg tid.  Patient did show good response to IV diltiazem 10
mg.

4)PE prophylaxis: Patient initially on Coumadin 12.5 mg qd and
Dalteparin 7500 units [**Hospital1 **], but were held due to GI bleed with
INR 2.9 and PTT 37.  Neurosurgery seen the patient and strongly
discouraged discontinuing Coumadin due to recent history of
intracranial bleed.  However, patient just had PE and is at risk
for another thrombotic event.  After discussion with the
neurosrugery attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**], it was decided to discharge
the patient with Lovenox.

5)ID: On [**8-4**] sputum gram stain showed gram positive cooci and
rhonchi on exam.  CXR intially appeared as LLL opacity so
Vancomycin 1 g q12 was started.  However after reviewing the
film with the team on [**2165-8-5**], CXR was more consistent with
fluid overload with effusion than consolidation.  Since patient
is afebrile with normal WBC and not showing symptom of
pneumonia, Vancomycin was discontinued.

Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH in [**State 108**] with R hip IT fx.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R hip ORIF

History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **]F with hx dementia, CAD, CHF EF 40%, chronic afib, lives
with 24 hour caretaker.  Was brought into OSH for neck pain and
inability to hold her head up as well as confusion, found to
have transverse C2 dens fracture, which has been immobilized
with [**Location (un) 5622**] collar.  Pt fell 3 weeks prior to admission,
but home aide stated that there were no injuries from fall.
Noted to have CHF exacerbation --> resolving with diuresis and
now is reportedly stable on [**3-20**] liters NC (uses no O2 at home).
In-house at OSH, had a fall and unfortunately suffered right
intertrochanteric fracture.  Pt has family in [**Hospital1 1559**] and had
pt med flighted from [**State 108**] to [**Hospital1 18**]. Family connection to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Reportedly, her C2 fracture is stable and the surgeons there
only wanted to immobilize it until her hip could be addressed.
.
Pt had a cardiology consult in [**State 108**], she had a CHF
exacerbation with a BNP of 15,000. Her Toprol XL was increased
from 37.5 to 50 mg PO qd with a plan to increase to 100 mg po
QD.  She was started on digoixin.  Her lasix was increased.
.
Of note, transfer paperwork notes that the pt was seen by PCP in
[**Name9 (PRE) 108**] for exertional CP and SOB relieved by NTG in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2143**].  At that time her Imdur was increased from 30 to 60 mg PO

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o dementia, CAD, diastolic CHF (EF 55%), severe
AS, chronic afib, transferred from OSH with R hip fracture and
possible C2 fracture for operative management of hip. She was
stable on the floor on her initial arrival.  Given her CHF and
AS, she was a high risk surgical candidate, but the family
decided to go ahead with the operation.  Postoperatively she was
in the MICU briefly for hypotension but was extubated without
difficulty, weaned off pressors after rehydration and
transferred back to the floor.  Perioperatively, she developed a
UTI and a LIJ clot, which were both treated.  Postoperatively,
she also developed delirium, and was less verbal than she was
previously.  She failed a speech and swallow evaluation, but the
medical team was optomistic that she would improve.  In the
meantime, multiple attempts at NGT placement were unsuccessful.

While on the floor, [**3-14**]-30, patient showed signs of
inability to clear her secretions.  On [**3-15**], she had an episode
of hypoxia.  CXR at that time revealed fluid overload, and she
seemed to improve with lasix.  Overnight that night, 1/2 blood
culture bottles were positive for S.aureus and Vancomycin was
started.  [**3-16**], she continued to do poorly, and again was
hypoxic.  CXR this time revealed dry lungs, but likely
aspiriation PNA or LUL.  Despite aggressive suctioning and
broadening of antibiotic coverage, Mrs. [**Known lastname 65362**] continued to
deteriorate and ultimately died approx 4:25 PM on [**3-16**].

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, red hands and feet

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, right IJ
central line placed, tracheostomy tube placed in OR

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] is a 73yo woman with h/o ALS who presents with 3
weeks of redness in her hands and feet as well as more recent
difficulty breathing. The patient had not complained of dyspnea
and her husband had noted tachypnea or respiratory distress but
per her husband she went to her doctor today, who noted that she
was ""not breathing well"" and sent her to the ER where she was
hypoxic in the 80s, responding well to O2 by NC.  She was then
found to have an ABG of 7.19/126/525/51 and was started on
Bipap.  She did not tolerate the non-invasive mask ventilation
despite sedateion (versed 2mg, and fentanyl 100mg).  She
experienced a reduction of blood pressure to 66/30, and was
subsequently intubated.

     Per husband, the patient has had ALS for three years. She
performs ADLs on her own but has had trouble with speech as well
as with keeping her mouth closed at baseline.  She has not had
any respiratory complaints.  She had previously lost 40 pounds
but last year was given a Gtube and since then has gained back
14 pounds.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] husband states that prior to the last 3 weeks
she was in her USOH, and denies any new symptoms including
cough, sputum, no sick contacts. She is entirely NPO and has
been for about a year. CXR in the ER showed no acute CP process
and UA was negative for signs of infection.

    Per the pt's husband they have never had any sort of
conversation regarding code status. The patinet did try bipap in
the past but was unable to tolerate it, but her outpatient
neurologist has never mentioned intubation or tracheostomy.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 94714**] states that these are all new thoughts for him and
he's not entirely certain what his wife would want at this
point.

    She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and she was started on AC
450x16, 100% FiO2, PEEP 5. ABG on this setting was
7.40/57/426/37 and her FiO2 was turned down to 50%.


Past Medical History:

[**3-15**] ECHO: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2179-3-5**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Slight ST segment elevation in leads
II, III and aVF which may represent active inferior ischemic
process. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**2179-3-12**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response, rate 160. Non-specific repolarization changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-3-5**] normal sinus rhythm
with abbreviated P-R interval has given way to atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response
.
[**3-21**] CXR: There continues to be dense opacification in the
retrocardiac region consistent with left lower lobe collapse and
a small left effusion. There are some patchy areas of increased
opacity in the right lower lung and left mid lung that may
represent early infiltrate or volume loss. There is no
significant change compared to the film from two days ago. The
right subclavian line is unchanged.
.
[**2179-3-22**] Renal US: Mildly echogenic but otherwise
normal-appearing kidneys may be secondary to medical renal
disease. 1.1 x 0.9 cm echogenic focus in the left kidney may
represent a cholesterol deposit versus a nonobstructing kidney
stone.


Brief Hospital Course:
# hypercarbic resp failure: This was felt to be likely ALS
induced muscular weakness combined with possible acute PNA given
LLL consolidation on CXR. She was intubated for repiratory
failure, and treated for a possible pneumonia. She was not able
to tolerate weaning off the ventilator, and therefore required
tracheostomy for longer term ventilator support. While awaiting
trach placement, Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] also developed a ventilator
associated pneumonia. She grew MRSA in her sputum and blood, and
was treated with a course of vancomycin. Zosyn was added after 5
days of vancomycin as she had repeated L lung collapse with
thick mucous plugging, and we wanted to cover for pneumonia as
well. Subsequent surveillance cultures were clean. Zosyn was
later switched to   Cefepime [**1-7**] worsening renal failure
attributed to Zosyn.  She completed an 8 day course of
antibiotics. Her tracheostomy went well, and she was started on
an in/exsufflator as well to aid in clearing her
secretions/mucous to prevent recurrent lung colapse.
.
# A fib: Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] had several episodes of atrial
fibrillation with RVR, all in the setting of L lung collapse.
She was initially started on a beta blocker with good response.
After having multiple episodes she was started on amiodarone and
anticoagulation with heparin. In all cases she converted to
sinus rhythm on her own. Shortly after starting heparin, she had
an episode of guaiac positive stool, and then a small amount of
melena. Her heparin was stopped, and was not restarted as she
remained in sinus rhythm, and the concern was that her risk of
GI bleeding is higher than her risk of stroke. Her PEG was
lavaged, and was OB negative. She will also need a colonoscopy
as an outpatient to further evaluate the cause of her melena.
She has subtle ST changes on inital EKG, but ruled out for an MI
by enzymes.
.
# hypotension: Ms [**Known lastname 94714**] was hypotensive on intial
presentation, responding well to fluid boluses. She had a
cortisol stimulation test with normal response. It became clear
that she responds to sedation with benzodiazepines with
prolonged hypotension (as well as increased delerium and
agitation), and therefore these were stopped, and put into her
allergy list. After cessation of benzodiazepines, her blood
pressure was much more stable, and she did not require bolusing.
She never required pressors.
.
# ALS: It was felt that she likely had progression of her ALS,
with diaphragmatic weakness and CO2 retention. Her respiratory
mechanics were repeatedly asessed, and showed that she would not
be able to come off the vent. Therefore a trach was placed in
the OR by thoracic surgery (IP unable to place due to her
anatomy).
.
# hyponatremia: Mrs [**Known lastname 94714**] was hyponatremic on admission. Tis
resolved with hydration, indicating that she was likely
hypovolemic and total body sodium depleted. She had no further
problems with this for the duration of her stay.
.
#Diarrhea: New on [**2179-3-24**]/ Slight increase in in WBC to 15.
Afebrile. No abdominal pain. Has been on course of antibiotics
for vent associated PNA. Those antibiotics stopped today. ALso
on tube feeds. C. Diff is a possibility given recent abx but it
may also be related to tube feeds. On C.Diff is pending. At this
point it is reasonable to follow fever curve and stool output.
C.Diff lab should be followed up. [**Month (only) 116**] consider empiric treatment
of c. diff with flagyl if febrile or diarrhea persists.
.
#Hypernatremia - Likely releated to low volume. WIll increase
free water with tube feeds from 100cc q4hr to 150cc q4h. A
chenistry panel should be checked on [**2179-3-26**] to make sure Na
remains stable.
.
# conjunctivitis: Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] had bilateral conjunctivitis on
admission. This resolved with a 7 day course of erythromycin eye
cream.
.
# skin changes: Ms [**Known lastname 94715**] intitial presenting chief
complaint was erythema of her hands and feet. Dermatology was
consulted, and said that she likely has erythromyalgia. The
treatment for this is sarna lotion and aspirin, and improvement
does not occur in less than a month. She was treated with sarna
and ASA throughout her stay. Additionally she had burns on the
inside of both thighs from a hot tea spill at home prior to
admission. Per dermatology recs, these areas were treated with
antibiotic cream and xeroform dressings, and healed over cleanly
without infection.
.
# FEN: Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] had a PEG on admission as she has not been
able to take PO intake for some time secondary to progression of
her ALS. She was continued NPO, with tubefeeds per nutrition. We
monitored & repleted her electrolytes lytes. She was kept
euvolemic.

#Renal Failure: Pt's Creatinine increased during this admission
from 0.7  to 1.3.
BUN remained around 20 .Urine lytes were consistent with
ATN>Reanla failure was attributed to ATN d/2 Zosyn.Although it
was chenged to Cefepime, there was no improvement. Renal US
showed no obstruction.
 Pt's creatinitne remained near 1.3.Plan will be to keep pt
hydrated , avoid nephrotoxins and follow creatinine as
outpatient.

.
# PPX: Ms. [**Known lastname 94714**] was treated with SC heparin, protonix, and
a bowel regimen. She did have some constipation, and her bowel
regimen was increased with good results.
.
# access: She was maintained with PIVs throughout most of her
hospitalization. Shortly before discharge a PICC line was placed
as she was losing all her peripheral access.
.
# code status: Per discussion with Ms [**Known lastname 94714**] and her husband
she was full code throughout her stay.

Brief Hospital Course:
58f with breast cancer, htn, chf, paf s/p pvi admitted with
pneumonia and afib with rapid ventricular response
.
Afib -- Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is maintained on amiodarone at home in sinus
rhythm.  It was felt that her pneumonia was the likely culprit
in this exacerbation back into fibrillation.  She was seen by
the EP staff who felt she would do well with a loading dose of
amiodarone of 400mg twice daily for three days; she would then
return to her usual dose of 200mg daily.  This was begun with a
good response.  Sinus rhythm was quickly re-instated.  Her
symptoms of dyspnea and palpitations seems to improved with
reversion to sinus.  She was discharged with one day of
loading-dose amidodarone left in sinus rhythm, with rates
generally in the 70's.
.
Pneumonia -- Although clinically mild, it was felt sufficient to
cause her loss of sinus rhythm.  She had no O2 requirement and
was treated with a course of levofloxacin.  By the time she was
discharged, she was afebrile with decreased cough and sputum
production.  Micro data was unrevealing.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 58 yo woman w/ h/o afib s/p ablation, chf(ef55%), htn,
breast ca who was just d/c'd yesterday([**12-26**]) afternoon w/ dx of
PNA and PAF on amiodarone load with coumadin and levofloxacin
after being treated with ceftriaxone/azithro while in house.
Returns to the ED with episode of acute onset of SOB, unable to
get breath, she tried to go to bed and went to bed around
midnight, but remained SOB and dry cough ('felt I was drowning')
around 1:30am also felt 'I was in afib with very fast heart
rate'. SOB improved with sitting up. Pt reported 2 lb weight
gain from Friday to Sat. No LE edema. Denied chest pain,
palppitations.
.
On way to [**Name (NI) **], pt received 100mg lasix, in ED, found to have
BP200's, with heart rate 100 initially in afib but subsquently
converted to sinus spontaneously. Temp 99.8, and O2sat 80's in
RA, RR50's was placed on nitro gtt and CPAP initially, BP
subsquently dropped to 80's/30's, stopped nitro gtt. Pt was
placed on 4L O2 NC improvment in sats to 99% and 250cc bolus and
then started on dopamine.
.
While in ED remained hypotensive as HR 110's and was started on
dopamine peripherally again at 2.5-5mcg/kg/min.  She has
diuresed about 1700 UOP since arrival.  As dopamine taken off,
HR improved and converted to NSR in 80's.  Then she started
rigoring and spiked a temp to 103.  She was transferred to the
MICU for close monitoring and a dopamine drip that was quickly
weaned off.

Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is borderline
left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Probably moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen (views suboptimal; seen  well in
apical 3 chamber view only). The left ventricular inflow pattern
 suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial  pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a  trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2148-9-13**],
mitral
regurgitation is now more prominent (as visualized in the apical
3 chamber  view). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is now higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 yo woman w/ h/o afib s/p ablation, h/o chf, htn, breast
ca, recent admission with LLL PNA and afib w/ RVR admitted with
increased shortness of breath and now fevers and hypotension.
.
.
Respiratory Distress: Ultimately it was felt that her symptoms
developed from her underlying pneumonia and an episode of rapid
atrial-fibrillation that caused pulmonary edema.  She was
diuresed with good effect with IV furosemide and a two gram
sodium diet.
Her antibiotic coverage was transitioned from levofloxacin to
azithromycin.  Urine and blood cultures failed to grow anything
and she was initially febrile, early in the hospital course,
despite antibiotic treament.  She was, however, afebrile, during
the forty-eight hours prior to discharge on azithromycin.  She
continued to cough intermittently, but this was well controlled
with benzonatate.
.
Hypotension: Occuring in the ED and resolving by the time she
reached the MICU, her hypotension, although originally felt due
to septic physiology, was ultimately thought to be secondary to
overdiuresis and anti-hypertensive therapy while in the ED.
Once her fluid status and heart rate were optimized, she
remained normotensive for the rest of the admission.
.
PAF:  She was continued on her amiodarone load with good effect,
as she remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of the admission.
Warfarin was also continued.  She was discharged on her home
dose of amiodarone 200mg daily.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective cornary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
unable to be
engaged selectively despite using a 4 french JL4, JL4.5, JL5.  A
five
french JL5, JL4.5, AL1, AL2, and AL3 were also unsucessful.  The
LMCA
was heavily calcified and had an ostial plaque.  There was an
80% distal
LMCA lesion that involved the origins of the LAD, ramus, and
[**Month/Day (4) **].  The
LAD had a functional ostial stenosis (extended from distal
LMCA);
signficiant proximal stenosis; and minimal flow into the mid
LAD.
Overall, the LAD was not able to be well visualized because of
difficulty engaging the LMCA.  The [**Month/Day (4) **] had a 90% stenosis in the
origin
that extended from the distal LMCA.  The AV groove [**Month/Day (4) **] supplied
a
diffusely disease OM1 (up to 70% stenosis) and LPL.  The ramus
was not
well seen but had an ostial 80% stenosis.  There was heavily
calcified
plaque in the aorta at the origin of the RCA.  The RCA had heavy

calcification proximally with 70% and 90% stenoses.  The mid
vessel had
a 50% stenosis. The distal RCA was a tortuous vessel that
supplied a
long lower acute marginal with lateral branches that supplied
the
inferior septum.  The native AV groove RCA was heavily calcified
and
subtotally occluded after the take-off of the large lower AM.
2.  Venous conduit angiography revealed an SVG to OM (engaged
with a 5
french AL2) that was patent thoughout and touched down onto the
lower
pole OM that does not communicate with the native AV groove [**Name (NI) **].
 The
SVG-rPDA (engaged with 5 french MPA) had an ostial 30% and mid
85%
stenosis; this graft retrogradely filled a severely diffusely
diseased
distal AV groove RCA that gave septal collaterals to the LAD.
3.  Nonselective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA
with a 30% ostial stenosis that touches down on a small calibur,
heavily
calcifed LAD (not well imaged).
4.  Left subclavian angiography revealed a heavily calcifed
vessel with
a proximal 50% stenosis.  The left subclavian stenosis prevented

advancement of a 4 french [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter despite use of an angled
glide
wire, slip catheter, and Amplatz stiff wire.  A 4 french
Berenstein was
ultimately advance to the subclavian distal to the LIMA over the
angled
glide wire.
5.  Left ventriculography was not perfomed secondary to renal
insufficency.
6.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated systemic systolic
hypertension
with a central aortic pressure of 167/68 (systolic/diastolic in
mmHg).
There was severe diastolic dysfunction with an LVEDP of 32 mmHg.
 There
was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
[**1-14**] Cardiac cath:
1.  Planned intervention of a 90% body of SVG-PDA lesion
with direct stenting with a Vision 3.5x18mm stent.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 142/59 with HR 55 with
significant
ventricular ectopy.
3.  Access via 6F long sheath in RFA.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Succesful direct stenting of SVG-PDA graft with bare metal
stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
#. CAD: The patient presented to an OSH on [**1-7**] with shortness
of breath and chest pain. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cathterization. This diagnostic procedure on [**2115-1-11**] was
complicated requiring a signficant amount of dye and radiation,
therefore, the intervention was planned for another day. It
demonstrated severe native 3vd, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90% [**Date Range **]
ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and patent
SVG-RPDA. He received Reopro post cathterization and developed a
hematoma requiring a pressure dressing. The patient developed
refractory chest pain without ECG changes before the
intervention could be performed, and was transferred to the CCU
for monitoring and management.
In the CCU, he was given Argatroban for ACS (reported concern
re: HIT). He had cardiac cathterization on [**2115-1-14**] with
intervention and stenting of SVG-RCA. His sheath was pulled
while on Argatroban and the patient developed a significant
hematoma requiring 2 units pRBC transfusion. The next day, the
patient developed stuttering chest pain and plans were made to
take him back to the cath lab for possible intervention on left
main or RCA. He was transitioned from a nitro gtt to isosorbide
for the chest pain. He was started on argatroban prior to the
procedure. He underwent a third catheterization on [**1-17**] with
stenting to his L. Subclavian.  He subsequently remained chest
pain free. He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, statin, and
Toprol. No further events occured, chest pain had resolved and
he was sent home on the above medications.
.
#. Systolic Heart Failure: An echo was performed which showed EF
60%.  Patient was continued on his Lasix and his beta blocker
was increased.
.
#. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm during most of his
hospital stay, however during the CCU he had a few episodes of
bradycardia and his beta blocker was held. This was subsequently
resumed prior to discharge.
.
#. Diabetes-Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale and
placed back on his home glyburide prior to discharge.
.
#CRI-Baseline 2.2 at OSH. It initially increased after the first
catheterization but subsequently improved after post-cath
hydration and IVF.  His creatinine was monitored and remained
stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.  All of the
medications were renally dosed and he received pre- and
post-cath hydration for each of his procedures.
.
#Hematuria-Pt has gross blood in foley which was thought to be
related to traumatic insertion. His foley was subsequently
flushed and there were no clots.  There was no further evidence
of hematuria and no further intervention was taken.
.
#BPH-Patient was continued on his home hytrin
.
#Thrombocytopenia-Patient has known chronic thrombocytopenia. It
is unclear what his baseline is, but at the OSH his platelets
were in the low 100s.  HIT Ab was sent which was negative.
Heparin was held throughout his stay and his platelets remained
stable in the 80s to low 100s. NO further intervention taken.
.
#Chronic Anemia-Pt on Procrit q week (tues). He received 2 units
of prbcs in the CCU for his hematoma and his HCt subsequently
remained stable. He did not receive any Procrit during his
hospitalization but this should be resumed per his regular
schedule upon discharge.
.
#Sciatica-Patient was continued on his home Neurontin.

seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the
inferior, septal and anterior walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened with focal calcification of
left coronary cusp causing aorto sclerosis. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post revascularization:

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man s/p cabg and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
HISTORY: Status post CABG with chest tube removal; to assess for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], the endotracheal
tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and nasogastric tube have all been
removed. Left chest tube has also been removed and there is no
evidence of pneumothorax. There is probably some residual
atelectatic change at the left base as well as in the right
upper zone, both of which are decreasing.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. He was seen by renal to
continue his HD. He was taken to the operating room on [**10-1**]
where he underwent an OPCABG x 2. He was transferred to the ICU
in critical but stable condition. He was given vancomycin
perioperative prophylaxis as he was in house preoperatively. He
was extubated the morning of POD #1. He continued on HD postop.
He was transferred to the floor on POD #1. He was started on
renagel per renal. He did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #4.

Chief Complaint:
prolonged R sided shaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with PMH notable for breast
CT
in [**2081**] (s/p R mastectomy), pancreatic CA [**2094**] (s/p whipple's),
colon CA d/c'ed [**1-2**], s/p total colectomy, who is transferred
from the ICU after presenting in partial status epilepticus.
According to the daughter, after her recent colectomy she has
had
complications of post-operative ileus, overall decreased po's
and
weight loss. She was in her nursing home and was relatively
stable until the day prior to admission when she was more tired
and not taking in any po's. That night her nursing aid noted
that
she had L face, arm, and leg twitching, unclear if true LOC
associated with it. The twitching began around midnight and
continued through the morning and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

IN ED she was noted to be talking coherently through the
twitching, with O2 sats down to the low 90's on 2L NC. She was
given a total of 4 mg ativan and then 1 gm dilantin bolus that
stopped the shaking, however she became so sedated that she
required intubation.

She was admitted to the ICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU/Floor course by system:

Neuro:
1. First time seizures - This episode was thought to be focal
status, and once stopped she never had a recurrent of
seizure-like activity. It was thought that perhaps her seizure
was secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities in the setting
of poor nutrition post operatively. She was continued on
dilantin, initially 100 mg IV TID, but her levels were
persistently supratherapeutic and upon transfer to the floor the
dilantin was held each day while levels were checked. On [**1-29**] the
level was finally within low-therapeutic range (4.4, when
corrected for albumin was approximately 9) and she was restarted
on 100 mg qday. It was thought that has intrinsic slow clearance
of dilantin, as none of her other medications are known to
decrease dilantin clearance. Upon discharge her level was 3.7.
Her levels should be followed 2x/week.
Further neurologic workup for seizure included LP that was
unremarkable and MRI that showed no enhancing lesions, one small
area of DWI right thalamus without FLAIR correleate of unclear
significance. Radiology reported diffuse meningeal uptake, but
this was likely s/p LP effects. No EEG was performed.
2. Encephalopathy - Pt was initially very encephalopathic,
thought to be due to infection as well as dilantin toxicity. As
her pneumonia was treated and her dilatnin level was reduced,
she became markedly awake and lucid, and by discharge was
conversant and easily following commands.

ID:
1. Aspiration pneumonia - She had a LLL infiltrate on CXR,
leukocytosis to
13K, low grade temp (98.8 ax), she was started on levofloxacin
and flagyl and completed a 10 day course.  Her wbc was 6 upon
discharge and her lung exam was much improved. Her blood and
urine cultures were negative to date.

Pulm:
She was intubated on [**1-20**] for airway protection after the
multiple sedating medications she received for her seizure. She
was easily extubated at 6pm on [**1-21**]. On [**1-24**] she had an episode
of acute respiratory distress, her CXR and lung exam were
consistent with pulmonary edema and she was given IV lasix with
excellent response. She was started on a maintenance dose of
lasix for the remainder of her stay and this was discontinued
upon discharge.

Heme:
On admission, hct dropped from 36->29, repeat was 32 She does
not appear to be iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease,
she does however have borderline low B12 and folate. Stool
guiaic's were negative. Her hct stayed around 28-29 for the
remainder of her stay.

Pain:
Continued fentanyl patch (for OA) to prevent withdraw, prn
tylenol.

FEN:
Pt was not PO'ing due to encephalopathy. Upon transfer,
nutrition consulted and plan for PICC placement for TPN made.
PICC was placed but it was only able to be placed peripherally,
therefore she was started on [**Month/Year (2) 32813**]. Electrolytes were followed
daily and her initial hyponatremia resolved. She also initially
had hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, all of which
were stabilized with her [**Month/Year (2) 32813**]. On [**1-28**] she passed her
speech/swallow evaluation and an oral diet was started. She
tolerated this well and upon discharge her [**Month/Day (4) 32813**] was discontinued
with plans to augment her oral nutrition as well as possible.
Her daughter met with the medial nutrition group prior to
discharge. Her electrolytes should be followed weekly. She also
should be restarted on pancrease once she is eating a more full
diet.

PPx:
for stroke ppx, was initially given ASA, but due to decreasing
hct and recent surgery, upon transfer the ASA was d/c'ed. As DVT
prophylaxis she was receive heparin in her [**Last Name (LF) 32813**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was not given
SC heparin, but was started back on SC heparin upon discharge.
For GI prophylaxis she was receiving pepcid, and was switched
back to her home regimen of protonix upon discharge.

Code: She was intially DNR but not DNI, after much discussion
with her daughter and her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] the decision was made
to make her DNR/DNI.

Dispo: She was transferred back to her nursing home in much
improved condition on [**2115-1-31**].

.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# acute blood loss anemia/hemoperitoneum: Likely bleeding from
hepatic tumors, however, angio did not identify obviously
bleeding lesions, so no embolization performed initially. Pt
then had increased abdominal distension and pain; repeat CT scan
did not show demonstrable change in hemoperitoneum, but could
not rule out continued oozing from liver lesions. R hepatic
artery was therefore embolized with Gel-foam to prevent
further/future bleeding.  Following procedure, patient had a
stable hematocrit, and did not require additional transfusions.

.
# Fevers: No clinical signs that would indicate current
infection, as pt w/o cough, SOB, dysuria, or diahrea.  Serial
blood cultures were without crowth.  Fevers believed to be
secondary either to diffuse cancer or blood in peritoneum.
.
# Pain: Pt swtiched from PCA to MS contin w/ diluadid PRNs.
While patient was significantly uncomfortable on admission, pain
ins well controlled at time of discharge.  Pain due to
carcinomatosis of abdomien.
.
# hepatocellular carcinoma: HepB +, widely metastatic. last
chemo over 2 weeks ago. As pt has failed multiple
chemotherapeutic regimens, felt that would not gain advantage
from additional treatment. Pt seen by palliative care, and their
assistance is most appreciated. Patient discharged with home
hospice.

Discharge Instructions:
You are discharged after an admission due to bleeding in your
belly.  This bleeding was from one of your liver tumors.  You
had the blood suppy to that tumor blocked so that it won't
bleed.  Because of these bleeding tumors, you are no longer a
canidate for the serafinib treatment.  Unfortuantly all the
chemotherapy we normally use to treat liver cancer has not
proven successful.  You are now being discharged home, and
arangements are being made to give you the support to remain
comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old female with a history of of hepatitis C and
alcoholic cirrhosis and known Grade I varices who presented with
UGIB secondary to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.

#UGIB- The patient has a history of esophageal varices and is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her cirrhosis. She is on nadalal as
one of her home medications. She developed hematemesis in the
ED, where she received 3L crystalloid and 2 units of PRBC. She
was trasnferred to the MICU, and she had an EGD  performed by GI
which revealed [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears of the esophagus. She was
monitored in the MICU and her HCT remained stable throughout her
MICU stay. She was started on sucralfate and received 48 hours
of a protonix drip. After transfer to the floor, she continued
to remain hemodynamically stable, although did continue to have
melanic stools. Her HCT continued to remain stable at discharge.
She was sent home with sucralfate and pantoprazole daily, along
with iron supplementation in the setting of acute blood loss.

#Hypovolemic shock- Patient presented with hypotension and
elevated lactate which resolved with fluid resusciation and
blood products.  Since her EGD, she remained hemodynamically
stable, her lactate trended down, and she required no additional
blood products.

#Altered mental status- Patient was found altered at home while
intoxicated. She had a positive flapping tremor and was started
on lactulose at time of transfer from MICU. The patient was
continued on a CIWA scale on the floor, and required minimal
diazepam for symptoms.

#Cirrhosis- Patient has alcoholic/HepC cirrhosis. SHe is
followed in the liver clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She is still actively
drinking per her postiive blood alcohol today in the ED.  Her
MELD score is 15. She has thormbocytopenia and known esophageal
varices. She has no history of ascites or hepatic
encephalopathy, however had a flapping tremor and was somnolent
at time of d/c from MICU, which was persistent on the floor. She
was treated with a 4d course of ceftriaxone in the setting of GI
Bleed.

#Alcohol abuse- Patient came to MICU intoxicated to >200 BAL.
Social work was consulted. The patient demonstrated interest in
attending AA after discharge.

#Hypertension- Patient was normotensive during MICU admission,
nadolol was restarted on transfer from MICU and continued on the
floor. Her home lasix and lisinopril were held in the setting of
GI bleeding, and she had no signs of fluid overload on the day
of discharge so these were not restarted.

#hypokalemia - K around 3.3-3.5. Unknown etiology. Was repleted
with PO K.

#Depression- Patient was restarted on citalopram once she was
able to tolerate PO

#Migraines- Fiorecet was held while in the hospital.

The patient was full code throughout admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to have
altered mental status. While you were here, you had an EGD after
some vomitting of blood which showed no change in your varices,
but there was evidence of tearing which most likely caused the
bleeding. There have been no changes to your home medications.
It is imperitive that you discontinue drinking, as this was the
most likely cause of your hospital admission. It was our
pleasure to take care of you while you were a patient here.
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions,
comments or concerns.

With Warm Regards,

Your Inpatient Medicine Team

right-sided posterior chest pain.

She notes that she was well until 4-days prior to admission when
she developed URI symptoms, including headache, rhinorrea, and
generalized fatigue. She subsequently developed a cough,
productive of small amounts of dark yellow sputum. Yesterday,

Relevant imagind studies:

[**2103-5-19**] CXR: Stable cardiac contours. Interval development of
patchy opacity in right lower lobe, no pleural effusion.

[**2103-5-20**] CXR: Heart size is within normal limits and there is no
evidence for CHF. There is consolidation in the right middle and
right lower lobes with an associated small right pleural
effusion, increased when compared with the prior film of [**5-19**], 05. There is atelectasis at the left lung base as previously
demonstrated. There is probably some associated collapse of the
right lobe.

IMPRESSION: Increase in extent of right middle lobe and right
lower lobe consolidation with small right pleural effusion. Left
basilar atelectasis.

[**2103-5-21**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal
in size and there is slight increase in pulmonary vascularity,
consistent with the patient's known [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell status. There
are multifocal areas of consolidation involving the right middle
and both lower lobes, which have progressed in the interval.
There are also bilateral probable small pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal consolidation suggesting
multifocal pneumonia. [**Year/Month/Day **] cell lung is in the differential
diagnosis if there are not infectious symptoms present.

[**2103-5-22**] CXR: No significant interval change.

[**2103-5-23**] CXR: Increased mild to moderate left pleural effusion.
Persistent right middle and lower lobe infiltrate with right
pleural effusion, stable.

[**2103-5-24**] CXR: Slight interval improvement in right middle lobe
aeration. Slight improvement in right pleural effusion. Stable
left pleural effusion with left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis.

[**2103-5-26**] CXR: Improving right middle lobe and left lower lobe
opacities. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion
unchanged.

********
[**2103-5-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitatino. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
22 year-old African-American woman with [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell disease
admitted with respiratory symptoms and right-sided back pain,
found to have RLL infiltrate + hypoxemia.

1) Pneumonia +/- acute chest syndrome: CXR on admission revealed
a RLL infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia, although acute chest
syndrome can not be ruled out. Examination was also remarkable
for hypoxemia, with saturation in the low 80s. She was
empirically started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for coverage
of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Hemophilus and pneumococcus, and
hydrated. She was afebrile on admission, but subsequently
developed a fever in hospital with rising WBC up to 34.6 on
[**5-21**]. She also developed worsening hypoxemia on [**5-21**] with
increasing SOB in the setting of decreasing hematocrit to 15.5,
then 14.3. An ABG revealed pH 7.41/38/70. A repeat CXR was
performed and remarkable for worsening RML/RLL pneumonia. Given
the above as well as inability to transfuse PRBCs [**3-21**] no
available cross-matched blood (multiple allo-antibodies), Ms.
[**Known lastname 14164**] was transferred to the ICU on [**5-20**].

In the ICU, supportive care was provided. She was continued on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. Sputum cultures returned as OP
flora, without predominance of organisms (can not rule out
Chlamydia or Mycoplasma). Blood and urine cultures all returned
negative. Serial CXRs initially revealed worsening picture, with
interval development of a LLL infiltrate consistent with
multilobar process, and bilateral pleural effusions. An echo was
performed that showed normal EF>60%. The effusions were
ultimately felt most likely [**3-21**] fluid overload in the setting of
aggressive IVF administration, and she was diuresed with Lasix
on [**5-23**] and [**5-24**]. She eventually improved and defervesced,
with decreasing oxygen requirements and improved radiographic
picture. Antibiotics were changed to PO Levofloxacin on [**5-24**],
Ceftriaxone D/C'd on [**5-24**] (received 6 days), and Azithromycin
D/C'd on [**5-25**] (received 7 days). She will complete a 14-day
course (total) of Levofloxacin (last dose on [**2103-6-1**]).

Of note, the effusions persist at discharge, stable in size. She
also has persistent leukocytosis with WBC 16.2 at discharge.
Both should improve with time. She will need follow-up imaging
after completion of her antibiotic course to document complete
resolution of infiltrate/effusion, as well as repeat WBC. If the
effusions persist, then a thoracentesis would be indicated to
rule out a parapneumonic effusion. She was given Pneumococcal,
Meningococcal and Hib vaccines prior to discharge. She will
follow-up with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week of discharge.

2) [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cell disease: Hematocrit on admission was 19.9 (around
baseline), down to 15.3 on [**5-20**] with 2+ [**Month/Year (2) 14165**] cells on
peripheral smear, then a nadir of 14.3 on [**5-21**]. The hematology
service was consulted. Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] has multiple allo-antibodies
and HRB absent which is rare except in some African-Americans.
The blood bank was unable to provide matched blood. She was
transfused 1 unmatched unit on [**5-22**] after pre-medication with
Prednisone 60 mg PO QD, without response. Further transfusion
was therefore held. Per hematology, folate was increased to 5 mg
PO QD. Her hematocrit slowly trended up to 22 at discharge. Of
note, ferritin was sent to rule out concomitant iron deficiency,
and returned elevated at 791. She had appropriate
reticulocytosis to 22% in the setting of her anemia.

She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Hematology within 1 week of
discharge. Treatment with hydroxyurea should be addressed.

3) Pain control: Pain control was achieved with Dilaudid IV prn
and pre-medication with Benadryl. She was switched to PO
OxyContin 10 mg PO BID and oxycodone for breakthrough on [**5-26**],
with fair pain control. Tylenol around the clock and Naproxen
were also added. She was discharged on
OxyContin/Oxycodone/Naproxen/Tylenol + bowel regimen.

4) Bacterial vaginosis: Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] was diagnosed with bacterial
vaginosis prior to admission, treated with Flagyl. She completed
a 5-day course of Flagyl in hospital, with resolution of her
symptoms ([**5-22**] --> [**5-26**]).

5) Oral lesions: While in hospital, she developed oral lesions
suspicious for oral HSV. She was started on Valtrex 1 gm PO TID
with plan to complete 3 days. She will complete her course as an
out-patient (last doses on [**2103-5-28**]).

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of CAD, CHF with EF of 40%, recent admission
with respiratory failure requiring intubation who presents with
total body pain and chest pain.  The patient's current symptoms
began on Saturday with nausea.  The following day (one day prior
to admission), the patient experienced aching throughout her
body, including her back, chest, and the back of her head.  This
morning, the patient awoke from sleep at 6am due to right index
finger pain, erythema, swelling, and calor which then spread to
the rest of her body (back, chest, back of head).  Finger pain
is described as stiff, sore, and achy with associated calor.
Total body pain is described as sharp body aches which is
generalized, which lasted until she received Morphine in the ED.
 The patient describes chest pain along with her total body
pain, and received SL Nitro x3 without relief.  The pain had
similar features to her prior anginal equivalent, during which
she experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper back
pain, but her current pain consists of nausea without dyspnea or
lightheadedness.

Chest pain was [**7-18**] on arrival and she was started on a nitro
gtt without significant relief of symptoms.  However, symptoms
resolved with morphine, currently 0/10.  EKG revealed sinus
rhythm with baseline LBBB and no acute EKG changes.  She
received Morphine and a 500cc bolus while en route with EMS, and
received additional Morphine in the ED.
.
On evaluation on the floor, pt was asymptomatic and complaining
of thirst.  She denies PND, reports 2 pillow orthopnea which has
remained unchanged for years.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**4-29**]): Two views are compared with the bedside examination
obtained some 10 hours earlier, as well as previous examinations
of [**4-16**] and [**2165-4-19**]. There has been clearing of the findings of
CHF and bilateral pleural effusions, with residual rounded LV
enlargement and atherosclerotic change involving the thoracic
aorta. The lungs appear hyperinflated, suggestive of underlying
obstructive disease; however, there is no focal airspace
opacity. There is diffuse osteopenia with slight anterior
wedging of several thoracic vertebrae and resultant slight
kyphosis. There is no acute abnormality of the thoracic
skeleton.
.
CXR ([**5-5**]):
1. Worsening pulmonary edema and increasing small pleural
effusions.
2. Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities, which may be due to
dependent
areas of pulmonary edema or superimposed secondary process such
as aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Followup radiographs
after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
.
CXR ([**5-6**])
CHEST, AP: Mild interstitial edema has slightly worsened. Mild
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged. Bibasilar consolidation is stable. The cardiac
silhouette is normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
IMPRESSION: Slightly increased vascular congestion.
.
SUPINE ABDOMEN ([**5-6**])
Limited study with partially imaged left abdomen. Bowel gas
pattern present is nonobstructive with air seen in non-dilated
loops of small and large bowel. There is no free intraperitoneal
air or pneumatosis. The cardiac silhouette is moderately
enlarged. There is a questionable deep sulcus sign in the right
hemithorax, which in the right clinical setting, may represent a
pneumothorax. There is small opacification in the left lower
lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with CAD s/p stent to mid-[**Name (NI) **], PTCA of jailed OM1, IVUS of
LMCA with MLA presenting with body pain and chest pain.
.
# CORONARIES:  Patient has h/o prior stent to [**Name (NI) **] and PTCA of
jailed OM1 presenting with atypical chest pain not concerning
for ACS.  There were no significant EKG changes in light of LBBB
(by Sgarbossa criteria), and CE's were negative.  The patient
was continued on Aspirin 162mg daily and Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
per outpatient regimen.
.
# PUMP/CHF:  Patient has a history of chronic systolic and
diastolic heart failure with EF 40% [**3-/2165**], moderate (2+) MR,
small secundum ASD with left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum at rest.  She appeared clinically fluid
overloaded without hypoxia, with BNP >45,000.  Pt had complex
course on the medicine floor with multiple episodes of worsening
resp status thought due to flash pulm edema.  Initially, her
symptoms responded to lasix and additional BP control.  However,
the renal function slowly worsened and she had a decreasing
response to diuresis.  Pt became progressively uremic and
confused on [**5-5**] with mild respiratory distress.  She was
transferred to the CCU on [**5-6**] and received 240mg Lasix IV bolus
followed by gtt.  She was aggressively diuresed, per renal recs,
started on Lasix 80mg PO BID.  She has had good volume output
with the lasix.  Patient has been in good volume status since,
has not had any further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.  Has
had fluctuating O2 requirements, at times saturating well on
room air and other times requiring 2L of O2.
.
# Chronic renal failure: Stage III CKD, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient has baseline Cr of 1.5 until [**Month (only) 956**] when baseline
increased to 2.4.  On this admission patient had worsening renal
function with creatinine rising from 2.9 to 4.3.  It was unclear
whether the patient's increasing creatinine was due to
dehydration vs volume overload - particularly given her
recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema and CXR showing
evidence of fluid overload.  She was aggressively diuresed in
the CCU and her volume status has been stable on 80 mg of PO
lasix [**Hospital1 **].  Patient and family have decided to decline
hemodialysis and focus more on comfort measures.

# Renal Artery Stenosis:  Patient with atrophic right kidney,
left renal artery stenosis.  Very likely that this is the reason
that she is very difficult to diurese and the reason why she
flashes easily.  She was originally planned for renal artery
stenting, but the procedure was held off because she was
unstable, requiring CCU transfer.  Goals of care were discussed
with patient and renal stenting was tabled as patient decided
against aggressive management and to focus more on comfort.
.
#  Body Pain:  Patient describes body pain since waking up in
the morning of her admission.  Unclear etiology, but likely
viral symptoms vs non-specific findings [**3-12**] CHF exacerbation.
Infectious workup was negative.  Leukocytosis resolved on
discharge.  Patient has had 2 transient episodes of chest pain
on this admission which was reproducible with palpation and
worse with movement, likely of musculoskeletal etiology,
relieved with 0.5 mg of PO morphine.
.
# Right Finger Pain:  Pt initially presented with right index
finger with erythema, swelling, calor consistent with gout;
septic arthritis or osteomyelitis was less likely given no
fevers, no effusion, no nidus of infection.  Resolved without
intervention.
.
# Hypertension:  Patient's home antihypertensives were initially
continued, but following her CCU transfer for recurrent flash
pulmonary edema, she was changed to amlodipine, carvedilol,
furosemide, and imdur.  Following her CCU admission she has been
stable with SBP ranging in 110s-130s.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Pt is intolerant of statins, and was not
given statins after discussion with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: goals of the
patient's care.
.
# Type 2 diabetes:  diet-controlled.  Covered with SSI in-house.
.
# GERD:  Continued Famotidine 20 mg Tablet per outpatient
regimen
.
# Goals of care: patient was made DNR/DNI while in the CCU.
Patient and family decided against starting hemodialysis,
preference was for comfort directed care.  Just prior to
discharge from the hospital, patient was asked to sign a DNR/DNI
form which would continue her DNR/DNI status during transport
and at the nursing facility, which she refused to sign.  Patient
repeatedly stated that she DID NOT want to be resuscitated,
however refused to sign the form.  She is amenable to her
daughter (HCP) signing the DNR/DNI forms for her, however the
daughter was not available prior to discharge to sign the
papers.  The daughter understands that she would be able to sign
the DNR/DNI papers at the nursing facility.  At the nursing
facility, patient's care should be focused on comfort care.

being treated for new PE presented to the ED with SOB and
productive cough. She was readmitted [**2107-1-17**] after she was
found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with
Levo/Flagyl and Vanco. Cultures were positive for MRSA. Levo and
Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA. The pt
recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on
her home O2 requirement. She was getting bridged for her
anticoagulation with Lovenox starting [**1-18**] in preparation for
discharge.  However, she developed severe abdominal pain and a
palpable mass in her L abdomen. A CT was showed a new large

Brief Hospital Course:
64F w/ h/o recurrent PE s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB on
anticoagulation, COPD, recently admitted for new PE, readmitted
for multifocal PNA, who developed a large abdominal wall
hematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections.

# Multifocal Pneumonia: She was admitted with multifocal
pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  She
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  MRSA was found to
grow in her sputum so she was continued on a 14 day course of
vancomycin. She originally presented with elevated WBC count and
left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of
antibiotics.  Her productive cough improved as well and she
remained on her baseline home O2 of 2L.  Approximately 4 days
after completion of her 14 day course of Vancomycin, the patient
developed worsening cough, SOB, and upper respiratory symptoms.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL.
The patient was started back on Levofloxacin/Flagyl.  Vancomycin
was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles
with GPC in clusters and chains.  Additionally, her sputum
culture grew out GNRs.  Levofloxacin was discontinued and
Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the
patient's long hospital course.  Her O2 sat remained stable
93-100% on 2L nasal cannula (which is her baseline).  She was
given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick
sputum.  Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E. coli.  Because of
the sensitivity profile of the E. coli and the patient's allergy
to penicillin and cephalosporins, the patient was continued on
Meropenem.  Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph.
 Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag
negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant.  Her
Vancomycin was discontinued.  She will continue a 14 day course
of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this
course.
.
# Pulmonary embolism/DVTs: She has had multiple PEs and has had
one even since the placement of a TrapEase IVC filter. CT during
recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of
filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot.
Admission labwork revealed an INR of 7.9.  Coumadin was thus
held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of
GIB on anticoagulation.  In the interim, therapeutic lovenox
injections were initiated, but within days of starting, she
developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox
injection site.  Once her hematocrit stabilized, she was started
on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap.  While [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have a large Hct drop
and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma.  She
was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
It was decided after her second hematoma while on
anticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the
benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  In terms
of her hypercoagulable workup, it has been negative thus far for
hyperhomocysteinemia, Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid
antibody. Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as
well as CEA, all of which were within normal limits. SPEP
revealed hypogammaglobulinemia, but was otherwise unremarkable.
During her hospital course, she also began to complain of
worsening lower extremity pain.  LENIs were obtained which
showed evidence of extensive, completely occlusive, bilateral
deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to
the popliteal veins.  Radiology felt that these clots were most
likely acute to subacute in nature.  In this setting,
hematology/oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks
vs benefits of anticoagulation.  Antithrombin III, prothrombin
mutation, Lupus anticoagulation and [**Location (un) 1169**] Venom Viper were
sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability.  The
hematology/oncology team still felt that the risks of
coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the
patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of
anticoagulation.

# Abdominal wall hematoma: As mentioned above, she developed a
large left-sided abdominal wall hematoma from a Lovenox
injection site that caused a significant hct drop (originally
28.1-->19.4).  Despite the drop, she remained hemodynamically
stable (has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed). She
received 3 units prbcs, 4 units FFP. Her hematocrit then
stabilized and once stable, she was restarted on heparin gtt.
Coumadin was re-initiated and heparin gtt was continued while
awaiting her INR to become therapeutic.  While [**Location (un) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have another Hct drop
(25.9-> 22.2) and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new
right-sided rectus hematoma.  She was subsequently transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring.  She was given 1 unit FFP and
9 units PRBCs between [**Date range (1) 39125**] until her hematocrit became
stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion.  It was
decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, the
risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and
she was not anticoagulated.  She has complained of [**6-16**]
abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable
hematocrits.  Her pain is most likely [**3-11**] to the large rectus
hematoma that will resolve over time.  Her Hct remained stable
after her anticoagulation was discontinued.

# Thoracic mass:  CT chest and abdomen revealed a stable
thoracic mass (stable x 3years) and thought potentially
consistent with neural cyst.  It was not further evaluated by
MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal
hardware in place s/p elbow surgery and facial plates.  It
should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains
unchanged in the future.

# ? Zoster:  Patient reports having a history of ""herpes"" on her
right buttock.  During her stay, she developed a tingling,
itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on her
right buttock over the S2, S3 dermatomal distribution.  There
were no vesicles appreciated.  She was treated with acyclovir.

# Candidal vaginitis:  Treated with fluconazole x 2 with
resolution of symptoms.

# H/o GI bleeding during recent admission: Recent colonoscopy
showed diverticulosis with no active signs of bleeding.  She had
no blood in her stools during this admission even while
anticoagulated.  Her stools were guiac-ed multiple times and
were found to be guiac negative.

# Constipation: She is constipated at baseline and requires
daily scheduled bowel regimen to maintian regularity.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on lipitor.

# Depression/SAD: Continued on Prozac, risperdone, wellbutrin,
and klonopin.

# Ulcerative Colitis: Remains in remission.  She was continued
on mesalamine.

# Orthostatic hypotension: She remained asymptomatic even while
ambulating with physical therapy.  She was continued on
midodrine.

Head CT [**11-17**]:Right basal ganglia 21 x 10 mm intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema. No prior studies were
available for comparison.
Head CT [**11-18**]: stable hemorrhage
MRI/MRA: MRI demonstrates the right thalamic hemorrhage, as
visualized on
the CT scan of [**2146-11-17**]. No additional areas of
susceptibility
artifact are detected. There are no signs of acute infarction.
MRA demonstrates flow in the major branches of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] and no
abnormal vascularity.
LEFT X-ray Knee and Hip:  No fracture, dislocation, or evidence
of hardware loosening.

CXR:A feeding tube has been withdrawn slightly in the interval.
Although the tip still terminates in the stomach, the most
proximal portion of the radiodense tip is likely just above the
GE junction level. Cardiac silhouette is stable in size and
demonstrates left ventricular configuration. There has been
interval marked improved aeration in the left retrocardiac
region with only minimal residual atelectasis remaining.
Bilateral pleural effusions are improved, resolved on the right
and nearly resolved on the left. There are no new or worsening
areas of opacification to suggest pneumonia.

Echo/TTE:The left atrium is mildly dilated. A patent foramen
ovale or small atrial septal defect could not be excluded by
color Doppler study. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
probable distal septal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is borderline depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. No cardiac source of embolus identifed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology - Mr. [**Known lastname 65376**] was admitted to the ICU for monitoring
once it was discovered that his left-sided was secondary to a
right sided thalmocapsular hemorrhage. In the ICU, he remained
hemodynamically stable however his neurological exam worsened
from left sided hemiparesis to essentially, hemiplegia involving
most of his left side, including face, arm, and leg. The
differential included hypertensive hemorrhage, mass, aneurysm,
or hemorrhagic conversion of an embolic. As the patient had
little recorded or reportable medical history it is unclear that
he had a history of HTN, but this was clearly the most likely
diagnosis as no mass was observed and the MRA was negtive for
vascular malformation. He was quite hypertensive at admission,
with BPs 200/100s requiring IV hydralazine for control. The
patient had a deterioration in his mental status after transfer
out of the ICU. An encephalopathy work-up revealed bilateral
pleural effusions thought to be secondary to possible aspiration
pneumonia. His antibiotic regimen was changed to Levofloxacin
and Metronidazole and he became alert and oriented within 24
hrs. He should complete another 6 days of Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.
Physical therapy has been involved with his care and he has been
moved to and from his bed to a chair. HbA1C, Lipids were normal.
His Trans-thoracic Echocardiogram revealed normal EF without
vegetations.

Respiratory  - pt intermittently required oxygen by NC. He was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and possible left
sided pneumonia which on repeat CXR [**11-25**] showed interval
resolution. He currently does not have an oxygen requirement.

FEN/GI - the patient had difficulty swallowing and had been
maintained with an NGT for adequate fluid and nutritional
intake. Speech and swallow recommended: 1. Continue with NG tube
feedings to maintain nutrition/hydration 2. PO diet consistency
of nectar thick liquids and purees as a SNACK only 3. Basic
aspiration precautions should be followed: a. Pt should be awake
and alert while eating
b. Pt should be seated upright in the bed during all meals. He
will likely benefit from f/u with a nutrionist in Rehab.
Pt. also with large left inguinal hernia. This is a
[**Last Name 19390**] problem that has not presented acute issues for
him.

Renal/GU - Patient admitted with hyophosphatemia and
hypomagnesemia which have responded well to both oral and IV
supplementation. His recent Mg and Phos have normalized. He has
[**Doctor First Name **] kept on Neuta Phos packets [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was evaluated by Urology service for difficulty with
Foley catheter placement in the ICU. A catheter was placed by
GU; they recommended a voiding trial and on [**11-25**] the catheter
was pulled and the patient voided spontaneously. The patient has
had microscopic hematuria and GU was made aware of this. Their
recommendation was that this could be followed up as an
outpatient.

ID - The patient had Klebsiella pneumoniae urosepsis. He was
initially placed on Gentamicin. He subsequently had a drop in
his platelets. Because the bacteria was also sensitive to
ceftriaxone he was switched as there was concern that the
thrombocytopenia (low of 65) was secondary to gentamicin. Once
the gent was discontinued, his platelets subsequently recovered
to normal range. He has been treated with Levaquin IV and Flagyl
for 2 days and should complete another 6 days of these two
antibiotics for the Klebsiella and the pneumonia.

HEME - Thrombocytopenia as mentioned above. Pt. had developed
anemia and was tranfussed two units of PRBCs in the ICU. He has
since had stable CBCs. His anemia was likely secondary to acute
illness. He was placed on Heparin 5000 U SC for DVT prophylaxis.

Musculoskeletal: Pt c/o pain in left knee. He underwent X-rays
of both knee and left hip earlier in the hospitalization as he
presented with a fall. These tests were negative for fracture or
change in hardware (secondary to left hip ORIF in past).

PODIATRY - the patient had severe nail fungus and Podiatry
debrided the nails. He has been receiveing LacHydrin
moisturizing cream to his feet for severe dryness. There has
been much improvement during his hospital course.

DISPO - Patient has no PCP and would definitely benefit from
regular medical follow-up. A phone number for [**Hospital **] will be provided. The patient will have f/u
appointments with Urology and Neurology/Stroke.
Patient will require long-term assistance with ADLs and will
benefit from inpatient rehabilitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female
with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2174**] with
a history of five myocardial infarctions, the last in [**2185-7-28**] as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 30%, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  On [**2185-11-11**],
she experienced transient episodes of left arm weakness
associated with slow speech.  Her husband called the
patient's doctor who recommended she present to the emergency
room.

On arrival her vital signs were stable.  Labs were
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were negative initially.  She
was admitted to the Neurology for work up of a question of
TIA or stroke.  She underwent MRI of the head upon admission
that was negative for an acute process.  While on the floor
on [**2185-11-11**], she was noted to become tachycardic in a sinus
rhythm to 150 and was noted to have rales on exam.  She was
given 40 mg of IV Lasix without significant response; she
received a second dose of 40 mg IV Lasix and then a code was
called when she subsequently was noted to drop her oxygen
saturation to the mid 80s on 100% nonrebreather.  She also
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.

She was intubated and briefly required Dopamine to maintain
her blood pressures.  She was then transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management of congestive heart
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2174**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 30%.
5.  Alzheimer's dementia.

Her primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1537**].  Her

0.25 Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa.
2.  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care
Unit, she was intubated and sedated.  She had pink, frothy
sputum suctioned from her G tube.  Her lungs had audible
rales at the bases.  She had a regular rate and rhythm
audible upon precordial exam with no audible extra heart
sounds.  Her abdomen was benign with positive bowel sounds.
She had no edema with 1+ distal pulses.  She was responding
to stimuli, but was sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit had a
sodium 134, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN
20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 124, INR 1.1.  White count 7,
hematocrit 33, platelets 211.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a left
axis, left bundle branch block.  There was no comparison
available at the time.

Chest x-ray with patchy vascular markings consistent with
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission to the
Coronary Care Unit was that the patient was a 75 year-old
female with severe coronary artery disease who developed
symptoms of left arm discomfort on the day prior to
admission.  It may or may not have represented anginal type
symptoms.  She was now admitted directly from the floor in
apparently decompensated congestive heart failure in the
setting of elevated systolic blood pressure (as high as 200).

The patient was able to be weaned off of Dopamine
expeditiously upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit.  She
was diuresed aggressively and successfully with IV Lasix.
She had a PA catheter placed upon admission in order to guide
her management with initial pulmonary artery pressures of
35/10 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10.  Of note,
this was following aggressive diuresis.

The patient did well with subsequent titration up of after
load reduction with Captopril and initiation of Isordil.  She
was able to be extubated successfully on [**2185-11-14**].  She
underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a
severely depressed LV function with ejection fraction of 20
to 30% and akinesis of the inferior row posterior walls and
moderate hypokinesis at the LV as well as 1+ AR and MR.

The patient subsequently did well and at the time of this
dictation on [**2185-11-17**], she is awaiting transfer to the
General Medical Floor where she will await eventual
disposition most likely to short term rehab.

TRANSFER STATUS:  Stable.

Service:  Cardiology

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a past medical
history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass grafting, multiple
myocardial infarctions, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 20-30% and hypertension.  The patient
was admitted for episodes of left arm weakness and developed
flash pulmonary edema and tachycardia in the hospital.  She
was transferred to the CCU for medical management and
diuresis.  The patient responded to treatment well and, on
[**2185-11-17**], she was transferred to the floor for further
medical care prior to discharge to rehabilitation.

The patient was stable throughout her course of
hospitalization on the medical floor.  She was restarted on
her preadmission medications.  Her congestive heart failure
was not an acute issue.  She was kept euvolemic throughout
the hospitalization and suffered no additional shortness of
breath, pulmonary edema or tachycardia.  Her blood pressure
did drop on occasion to 80-90/40.  The patient was
asymptomatic during these episodes and blood pressure
elevated spontaneously to greater than 100/50.

The patient had fevers in the CCU with negative blood
cultures.  She was started empirically on Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole.

On the hospital floor, she was noted to have one bloody
stool.  Hematocrit was stable.  The patient's family notes
that the patient has been having bloody stools on occasion
over the past few years.  They have related to her congestive
heart failure exacerbations.  The patient underwent an
abdominal CT which showed evidence of proctitis to a very
mild degree with some thickening of the bowel wall and
stranding.  The CT also noted an abnormally thickened and
calcified gallbladder wall with a question of worrisome
gallbladder.  The patient was referred go Gastroenterology.
She underwent a liver/gallbladder ultrasound which revealed
cholelithiasis and evidence of adenomyomatosis, a benign
non-premalignant condition for which no follow up is
necessary.  Due to the patient's age and presentation, late
onset of ulcerative colitis was suspected for the occasional
bloody stools.  On flexible sigmoidoscopy, the patient was
shown to have multiple non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  The
appearance was consistent with ulcerative colitis.  Biopsies
were taken and the results are pending.  Due to the patient's
very mild disease activity without pain and only occasional
bloody stools without a drop in hematocrit, it is not clear
at this time whether treatment with steroids or 5-ASA enemas
is indicated.  The patient will follow up with
Gastroenterology for these issues.  The patient's hematocrit
was stable throughout the admission.  The patient's diet was
advanced and she took p.o. well.

The patient is discharged in good condition to long term
rehabilitation.

[**10-14**] Tagged RBC Scan -  Moderately brisk intermittent bleeding
originating from the ascending colon.

[**10-28**] CT - ?cortical infarct or pyelonephritis, small simple
left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**10-13**] from OSH with lower GI bleed since
patient was a Jehovah's witness and continued to have bloody
bowel movements. Patient was admitted to the medical ICU and
underwent a tagged RBC scan which suggested that the bleeding
eminated from the ascending colon. Angiography was then
performed which did not visualize the source of bleeding. The
patient continued to have BRBPR and the general surgery service
was consulted. Upon consultation the patient was found to have a
hematocrit of 13.7 and an emergent colectomy was offered to
resolve the active bleeding.

The patient refused blood products citing her religious
perference and all the patient was aware of all risks of the
procedure and consented. The patient went to the OR on [**10-14**] and
underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileocolostomy. The
procedure was without complications and the patient was
transfered to the TSICU in critical condition. Patient remained
on the ventilator for several days, and was started on
erythropoetin and IV Iron to maximize her RBC production
capability. She was started on parenteral nutritional prior to
return of bowel function.  She was successfully extubated on
pod# 10 and transfered to the floor once her hematocrit
stabilized. Once the patient was transferred to the floor her
hematocrit slowly increased each day and upon discharge was 23.

GI Bleed - The patient continued to have guiac positive stool
while in the ICU however these were felt to be the result of
retained blood in the colon. After the patient was transferred
to the floor patient had no episodes of BRBPR and no evidence of
GI bleeding.

Heme - Upon discharge the patients hematocrit was 23.9 which was
significantly higher than her post op Hct of 8. The patient was
started on 20K Units of EPO and will continue therapy for 1 week
as well as Iron supplementation for 1 month.

Pulm - Post operatively the patient developed a left lower lobe
pneumonia which was treated with a one week course of cipro.
Upon discharge the patient was afrebrile with a normal WBC.

GI - The patient was started on parenteral nutrition while in
the unit however was advanced to a regular diet after admission
to the floor. Patient was discharged able to tolerate a regular
diet.

CV - Patient continued to be tachycardic throughout her hospital
course as a result of her anemia. She was also hypertensive on
several occassions which was treated with IV then PO Lopressor.
Upon discharge the patient remained tachycardic and continued to
have episodic hypertension which we will have her PCP follow up
on.

GU - While in the ICU the patient developed an enterococcal
urinary tract infection which was treated appropriately with
antibiotics

Dispo - Patient will be discharged to short term rehab and will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] in approximately 1-2 weeks

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] presents with her daughter with 3 month
history
of worsening nausea, weight loss and decreased appetite. She was
initially evaluated and admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital [**Date range (1) 39208**]
after she fell on her back after slipping on a wet surface. On
arrival, she was also found to have nausea and abdominal pain at
which time a pelvic mass was discovered on exam. She underwent
CT
evaluation and received IVF and pain meds. Her abdominal and
back
pain improved with vicodin and darvocet. Following her discharge
on [**9-13**], she was informed by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] that this was
likely an ovarian malignancy but that she should undergo
colonoscopic evaluation. She started the prep with Golytely but
felt so awful during this, that she declined to actually undergo
colonoscopy.
.
Patient came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Continues to experience
abdominal pain, confirmed to have a large pelvic mass, 16cm, and
small lesions in liver (cannot characterize) and uncinate
process. Pathology consistent with either GYN primary (ovarian)
vs Renal.

Previous biopsies:    [**-6/3848**]  ABDOMEN BX.

DIAGNOSIS:
Pelvic mass resection:
I.  Pelvic mass (A-E):
Epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (see note).
II.  Lymph node, left external iliac (F-H):
No malignancy identified (0/2) nodes.
III.  Segment of bladder dome (I and Z):
Malignant mesothelioma involving bladder wall and undermining
the mucosa.
The tumor does not appear to arise from bladder mucosa and no
in-situ carcinoma is seen.
IV.  Peritoneal tumor (J):
Malignant mesothelioma in adipose tissue.
V.  Bladder, vagina, and pelvic mass (K-R, X-Y):
Malignant mesothelioma extending into vagina and bladder walls.
 The tumor does not appear to arise from the vaginal or bladder
mucosa and no precursor lesion is seen.
VI.  Segment of small bowel (S-T):
Malignant mesothelioma involving serosa of small intestine of
bowel.
The tumor does not arise from the bowel mucosa and no precursor
lesion is seen.
VII.  Omentum (U-W):
Malignant mesothelioma.

[**10-11**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema. Patient S/P surgery.
Comparison is made with prior studies including most recent one
dated [**2115-10-10**].
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Right transvenous
pacemaker leads terminate in standard position in the right
atrium and right ventricle. There is no CHF. There is minimal
vascular engorgement which is stable. Blunting of the left
lateral costophrenic angle with adjacent lung opacity is
unchanged, due to small pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.

[**10-10**]: LENIs
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed
bilaterally. Normal compressibility, flow, waveform, and
augmentation is demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**10-8**] LENIs
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins were performed. Normal compressibility,
augmentation, flow, and waveforms were demonstrated. There is no
evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
.
CT [**2115-10-9**]
IMPRESSION:

1. New small bilateral pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis (left greater than right).
2. Small amount of ascites which has slightly increased in size
since the prior study.
3. Pelvic loculated fluid collection that may represent an
organizing postoperative fluid collection/ hematoma.
Alternatively, less likely, this may reflect residual
tumor.There is a 3.7 x 4.2 cm cystic collection in the left
aspect of the pelvis (series 2, image 6 and 7). This collection
has a faint peripheral hyperdense rim that may reflect an
organizing postoperative fluid/hematoma. Although no frank
pocket of gas are seen within the fluid collection, a
superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Alternatively, this
may be related to residual tumor.
4. No evidence of colitis, free air, pneumatosis or bowel
obstruction.

CT Scan Pelvis [**2115-9-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large heterogeneous, lobulated pelvic mass seen, most likely
of gynecological origin. Patient recalls history of TAH/BSO,
however, prior records not available at time of dictation. Less
likely considerations include lymphoma (although very unlikely
given no lymphadenopathy identified elsewhere), or bladder
origin.
2. Marked extrinsic compression of sigmoid colon, without
evidence of obstruction.
3. Right sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
4. Small hypoattenuating lesions seen within the liver.
Metastases cannot be excluded.
6. Compression fracture of L1, of [**Last Name (un) 5487**] chronicity.
7. Poorly defined low attenuation lesion in uncinate process of
pancreas, incompletely evaluated on this study. Primary versus
secondary neoplasm suspected.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Pelvic Mass:  On [**2115-9-19**] the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 61**] to be evaluated by surgical and gynecological services.
Abdominal CT scan showed - 15.9 x 14.2 x 15.9 cm mass ,
incompletely encasing sigmoid colon. Small amount of oral
contrast seen passing through sigmoid colon. Mild dilation of
colon proximal to mass. Given the involvement of the sigmoid
colon, the patient was admitted to the General Surgery team for
possible surgical resection.  On [**9-24**], a CT guided biopsy was
performed which showed features suggestive of an unusual ovarian
adenocarcinoma.  The staining pattern suggests clear cell
carcinoma of the ovary, or possibly metastatic endometrial
carcinoma.  Adrenal, renal or colonic origin are unlikely.
Mesothelioma is unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded based
on the available information.
Given the pathology findings, the patient was transferred to the
GYN ONC service for further management.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, pelvic mass
resection and cystectomy with ileoconduit placement by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 1022**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] on [**10-2**]. Please see operative note for
details. The patient was admitted to the ICU postoperatively
given 2 minutes of hypotension during surgery.

#Nutrition/GI:
Preoperatively, a PICC line was placed for TPN given minimal PO
intake. Postoperatively, the patient's TPN was restarted.
TPN was restarted following surgery. Nutrition consult
following. The patient passed flatus and bowel movement
postoperatively; her diet was advanced to regular. TPN continued
until time of discharge due to limited PO intake. The patient
refused TPN at time of discharge.

The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy which revealed normal 15cm
but unable to advance scope due to insufficient bowel cleansing.


#ID:
The patient was started on Flagyl/Keflex postoperatively for
empiric treatment given extent of surgery.

-Pseudomonas infection: Postoperatively, her WBC was noted to
double from 12 to 25. Peak WBC 39 while in the ICU.  Blood
cultures, JP fluid cultures, urine culture from ileo-conduit and
wound culture were obtained. Pan-sensitive pseudomonas returned
in urine, wound and JP drainage. An ID consult recommended IV
and PO vancomycin and Zosyn.  A CT scan was performed which
demonstrated a post operative fluid collection vs hemotoma vs.
organizing infection. An interventional radiology consult stated
that the fluid was not-amenable to drainage. As the patient's
WBC improved with IV antibiotic treatment and the patient
remained afebrile, further surgical management was not pursued.
Her antibiotics were narrowed to Zosyn IV. The patient was to
receive PICC line IV treatments for total 14 days following
discharge. Her WBC was normal at time of discharge. A repeat
urine culture pending at time of discharge; but no bacteria
present on urinalysis.

#Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative 2. The
patient remained on room air. A CT scan on [**9-27**] was performed to
evaluate for pulmonary metastasis; this workup was negative.
The patient experienced acute dyspnea on postoperative day 9
during a blood transfusion. She received 2 doses of albuterol
nebulizers; she desaturated to 89% room air.  She needed minimal
oxygen support upon her readmission to the ICU.  She was
discharged on room air.

#Heme:
The patient's HCT was followed closely. The patient received 9
units of blood during surgery and her initial postoperative stay
to keep her HCT above 25. On postoperative day 9, the patient's
hematocrit was noted to be slowly dropping from 28 -> 26 -> 23.
It was unclear the cause of the hematocrit drop: slow bleeding
from operative site vs hematoma.  The patient was transfused [**12-25**]
unit of blood before hemolytic reaction occurred (see below).
This blood transfusion was discontinued immediately. During her
2nd ICU stay, the patient received 2 additional pRBC units that
were screened by the Blood Bank after consultation with the
transfusion fellow.  Her postoperative HCT remained stable daily
after the hemolytic reaction (bewlow) at 29-30.

-Hemolytic Reaction:  The patient experienced an acute hemolytic
reaction manifested by acute onset of dyspnea on postoperative
day 9. This unit of blood was discontinued immediately. She
received 2 doses of Albuterol nebulizer treatment. She received
25 mg Benadryl, 40 mg Lasix IV and 20 mg proton pump inhibitor.
Due to the patient's acute pulmonary distress and elevated
respiratory rate to 40, a code Blue was called to facilitate any
need for possible intubation.  No intubation or cardiac
resuscitation was needed.  A transfusion fellow consult was
called stat. A repeat type and screen found a JKA antibody in
the patient's blood. The patient was transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring.

#Cardiac: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation
prior to surgery. The patient was rate controlled prior to
surgery with Metoprolol and Diltiazem in the 80s-90s. She was
followed on telemetry. A medicine consult was called
preoperatively for assessment of her cardiac function. Prior
cardiac evaluation was obtained from her PCP documenting an
ejection fracture of 55% on recent Echo and 65% on recent stress
test.
Following surgery, postoperative cardiac enzymes were negative x
3.

-Hypotension: Occurred intraoperatively for which the patient
was placed on 2 pressors which were weaned off in the ICU. The
patient maintained a MAP of 65 per A-line. All pressors were
discontinued by time of ICU discharge and Metoprolol was
restarted.

-Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was maintained on telemetry
and rate controlled with Metoprolol in the 80s-90s.  She was
restarted on her Coumadin when tolerating adequate PO on
postoperative day 11.
.
# Pain: Patient had high level of post-operative pain treated
with morphine PCA which was transitioned to PO due to patient
somnolence. Patient able to wean off pain medications and as of
[**10-9**] required minimal PO medications.
.
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated following surgery to 1.6 attributed
to multiple transfusions intraoperatively. The patient responded
well to one unit of FFP with INR 1.2. INR trended to 1.0
spontaneously prior to discharge.  INR followed daily following
restart of Coumadin. INR 1.1 at time of discharge. VNA to follow
INR daily upon discharge.
.
# Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine continued
.
# Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, aspiration precautions,
pneumoboots when patient accepted.
.
# Code: Full, confirmed w/ HCP

#Dispo: Patient discharged on [**10-16**] with VNA services, ostomy
care, and follow up with Urology, INR checks to be followed by
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 39209**] and Thoracic oncology.

Chest CT
FINDINGS: Multiple bilateral solid and ground-glass pulmonary
nodules are new or increased from prior examination, measuring
up to 5 mm. Biapical and peripheral pleuro-parenchymal scarring
persist, with associated ground-glass opacities, suggestive of
interstitial lung disease. There is no focal consolidation. The
central airways are patent to the subsegmental levels.
Evaluation of intrathoracic vasculature is suboptimal without
intravenous
contrast, but there has been interval progression of diffuse
atherosclerotic calcifications. At the origin of the right
brachiocephalic artery, a 1.5-cm segment of severe stenosis now
demonstrates near-complete luminal occlusion.
Moderate orificial stenosis of the left common carotid artery
also appears
more prominent. In the proximal left subclavian artery, a 1.4 cm
segment of moderate stenosis now demonstrates near-complete
luminal occlusion. Extensive calcifications are also noted
involving the aortic arch and root, three coronary arteries, and
posterior descending artery.
Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber, measuring 3.3 cm at the
level of the main pulmonary artery, 2.7 cm at the arch, and 2.5
cm in the descending portion.
Central pulmonary arteries are unremarkable. The heart is normal
in size,
without pericardial effusion.
Prominent left axillary lymph node measures 9 mm, with fatty
hilum.
Intrathoracic lymph nodes are stable, measuring up to 5 mm in
the superior
paratracheal region, 7 mm in the precarinal region, and 7 mm in
the subcarinal
region.
Note is made of mild pectus excavatum.
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but
reveals dense calcification of the abdominal aorta with severe
celiac artery stenosis.
Bilateral non-obstructing renal stones are present.
Calcifications in the
region of the porta hepatis are likely vascular.
The bones are diffusely mottled and sclerotic, with mild
multilevel
degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of severe atherosclerosis.
2. Interstitial lung disease, with multiple new pulmonary
nodules measuring
up to 5 mm. Recommend followup CT in [**6-10**] months, depending on
patient's risk
factors.
3. Bilateral non-obstructing renal stones.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.[**Known lastname 83206**] presented for cardiac catheterization which
revealed significant coronary artery disease.  Cardiac surgery
was consulted and she underwent preoperative evaluation which
included CT scan of chest that recommends follow up CT scan in 6
months to evaluate pulmonary nodules.  On [**6-6**] she was brought to
the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, see
operative report for further details.  That evening she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without complications.  On post operative day one she
was weaned off phenylephrine and started on lasix for diuresis.
That evening she was started on betablockers/ statin/aspirin and
diuresis.  Chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed per
protocol. She continued to progress and was transferred to the
step down unit for further monitoring. Physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility. By post-operative day #5 she
was ready for discharge to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab.  All follow-up
appointments were advised.

Admission ECG [**2159-5-24**]:
Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-3-20**] there
is ST segment elevation in the inferolateral leads and ST
segment depression in the anteroseptal leads suggesting acute
myocardial infarction of the inferolateral territory.

Repeat ECG [**2159-5-24**]: Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Probably mid-right coronary lesion with ST segment depression in
lead aVL and aVR being negative. ST segment elevation in lead
III greater than in lead II. A-V dissociation is not present.
There is some irregularity to the rhythm suggesting capture
beats. This may be interference dissociation with a junctional
rhythm that is rapid. Since the previous tracing of [**2159-5-24**]
junctional rhythm is present with interference dissociation.

Admission CXR [**2159-5-24**]: Low inspiratory lung volumes, but
otherwise no acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Cardiac Cath [**2159-5-24**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had no
angiographically apparent disease. The Cx had no
angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a proximal 50%
stenosis as well as a distal 70% stenosis that was thrombotic

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: No acute intracranial abnormality
CT C-spine w/o Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: No evidence of acute fracture or
malalignment of the cervical spine.

CT Sinus/Mandidble/Maxillofacial Non-Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: Multiple
facial fractures are seen involving the bilateral nasal bones,
bilateral maxillary sinuses (anterior, lateral, posterior and
medial walls), the right palatine process of the maxilla and
palatine bone, bilateral
pterygoid plates, bilateral frontal processes of the maxillae,
right lateral orbital wall and right orbital floor.  The globes
appear intact. No extraocular muscle herniation is seen. The
bilateral lamina papyracea are intact. Blood is seen throughout
the bilateral maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, sphenoid
sinuses and frontal sinuses.  Soft tissue swelling and hematoma
is seen in the frontal scalp along with
subcutaneous emphysema extending to the right periorbital region
and along the right cheek. Subcutaneous emphysema extends to the
masticator space
bilaterally, right greater than left. The globes appear intact.
No
mandibular fracture is seen. IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral
facial fractures with involvement of the right lateral orbital
wall and floor as described above. The globes appear intact and
no evidence of ocular muscle entrapment is seen.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: 1. No acute
traumatic injuries seen within the torso. 2. Left adrenal
nodule, which does not meet criteria for an adrenal adenoma on
this exam. Further evaluation with dedicated CT or MRI of the
adrenal glands is recommended. 3. Mild dependent atelectasis in
both lungs.

TTE [**2159-5-25**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral
and inferoseptal akinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Moderate regional biventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
RCA-territory infarction and RV infarction. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Cardiac Cath [**2159-5-25**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease. The RCA was 100% occluded
proximal
to the prior stent. The LCA was not engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed severe hypotension with
a
central pressure of 86/53 mmHg on high dose dopamine.
3. Successful placement of 40cc IABP for hemodyanamic support.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease with occluded RCA due to
stent
thrombosis.
2. Severe hypotension on high dose dopamine.
3. Successful placement of IABP for hemodynamic support.

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2159-5-29**]: 1. New small right parafalcine
subdural hematoma. 2. New scalp collections, left greater than
right, likely evolving hematomas. Overlying fascial enhancement
is likely inflammatory, but please correlate clinically to
exclude the possibility of superimposed infection.

CT Sinus with Contrast [**2159-5-29**]: 1. Extensive facial fractures as
described above, overall unchanged in appearance since [**2159-5-24**]. 2. Interval increase in opacification of the paranasal
sinuses, in part due to blood. This is a common finding in
intubated patients. However, acute sinusitis cannot be excluded,
if it is suspected on clinical grounds.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast [**2159-5-29**]: 1. No acute
intra-abdominal pathology or source of infection identified. 2.
Interval development of small pericardial effusion and moderate
bilateral pleural effusions with fissural component on the left.
Compressive atelectasis of left greater than right lower lobes.
3. Fatty deposition in the liver. 4. Interval development of
trace amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvic
cavities, as well as interval increase in subcutaneous edema
likely
reflect a slightly fluid overloaded status.

TTE [**2159-6-2**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
secondary to extensive inferior and posterior akinesis with
focal dyskinesis of the midventricular segment of the inferior
free wall. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings
of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-6-1**], focal
dyskinesis of the inferior free wall is now present.

TTE [**2159-6-4**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infer-septal, inferioa,
and infero-lateral hypokinesis to akinesis. The apex appears
hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2159-6-2**], no change.  IMPRESSION: No VSD or pseudoaneurysm
seen.

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2159-6-6**]: 1. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage. Previously seen tiny right parafalcine subdural
hematoma has since resolved. 2. Multiple facial fractures as
before, incompletely assessed on this study.  No new fracture is
identified. 3. Resolution of small bilateral scalp hematomas.

ECG [**2159-6-10**]: Supraventricular tachycardia with a ventricular
premature beat. Inferior ST segment elevation with Q waves and T
wave inversions suggesting an myocardial infarction, could be
recent/acute. T wave inversion in leads I, aVL and V5-V6 also
suggest ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads.


Brief Hospital Course:
52yo male admitted after motorcycle accident and found to have
inferior STEMI, who underwent emergent cardiac cath with BMS to
distal RCA.

#) STEMI - Patient brought to CCU s/p emergent cardiac cath for
inferior STEMI, which revealed a proximal 50% stenosis of the
RCA as well as a distal 70% stenosis that was thrombotic and
ulcerated.  Patient had BMS placed in distal RCA.  There was
evidence of right ventricular ischemia/infarction. Of note,
patient had no previously known h/o CAD, but his urine tox
screen was positive for cocaine on presentation. The patient
later denied any recent cocaine use.  A TTE obtained the next
day revealed moderate regional biventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w RCA-territory infarction and RV infarction,
mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. The
patient developed ventricular bradycardia and hypotension, and
Swan that was placed showed elevated pressures in RA, RV, LA/WP
indicating biventricular failure.  Repeat cath the following day
showed thrombosis of RCA stent, and a decision was made to
medically manage the patient as at this point microvascular
perfusion was severely impaired by distal embolization and clot
formation.

 Post cath he was gravely ill with acute systolic CHF and right
ventricular failure.  He had an IABP placed for support, which
was gradually weaned and pulled.  His cardiac enzymes peaked on
[**2159-5-26**]: CK 4480, MB: 300, Trop: 6.21.  The patient was
aggressively diuresed after developing significant pulmonary
edema, and his fluid balance was closely monitored given his
pre-load dependence in setting of RV infarct.  He had several
repeat TTEs during the admission, and most recent echo was on
[**2159-6-4**].  Echo showed severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infer-septal, inferioa, and infero-lateral
hypokinesis to akinesis, a hypokinetic apex, mildly dilated RV,
mild global free wall hypokinesis, mod-severe MR, and a small to
moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.

#) Supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation - On night
of initial presentation, s/p PCI, rhythm went from sinus
tachycardia to atrial tachycardia with ventricular bradycardia;
BP 60-70/40s. Arrhythmia thought to be secondary to AV nodal
infarct (RCA branch) causing some degree of heartblock.  Per EP,
patient appeared to have 2:1 conduction at higher HRs with good
conduction at lower HRs (~50), and pacemaker was not indicated
at the time.  On [**2159-5-28**] patient had several episodes of
sustained monomorphic V tach, lasting up to 2 min at a time with
increasing frequency.  Per EP recs, patient started on
amiodarone bolus and drip.  He continued to have several runs of
non-sustained V-tach, and was started on metoprolol tartrate for
additional rate control.  The amiodarone was later stopped, but
the patient was continued on metoprolol.  He began having
several episodes of a fib/flutter on [**2159-6-7**], without
hemodynamic compromise, and his rhythm would spontaneously
convert back to normal sinus rhythm. He had an episode of
symptomatic bradycardia on [**2159-6-10**], with ECG/telemetry showing
retrograde p waves and junctional rhythm, rate 50/min.  The
patient was subjectively SOB but not hypoxic, and episode was
brief.  No further episodes of symptomatic bradycardia, but
patient should be closely monitored. Of note, patient had
episode of a fib/flutter on [**2159-6-10**] for which he received 2.5mg
metoprolol IV, with resultant drop in BP and requiring 250cc
bolus NS.  His CHADS score is 1 and he will receive aspirin for
thromboembolic prophylaxis.

#) Systolic heart failure:  Patient has left ventricular
dysfunction likely seconary to his STEMI with an ejection
fraction of 30%.  His heart failure regimen includes metoprolol,
lisinopril, and spironolactone.  He was initially managed with
lasix but was autodiuresing well, so his lasix was held on
[**2159-6-10**].  This will need to be restarted as an outpatient to
prevent volume overload.

#) Hypotension - On night of presentation s/p cath, patient
developed atrial tachycardia with ventricular bradycardia and BP
60-70/40s.  He was started on Dopamine for pressure support, and
would require ongoing support with several pressors to keep MAP
at goal of >65. He was eventually weaned off pressors, however
his SBPs generally remained in the 80s-90s.  He had some degree
of orthostatic hypotension, and his anti-hypertensive and
diuretic regimen were adjusted accordingly.  Of note, patient's
SBP persistently in 80s-90s in days prior to discharge. Patient
asymptomatic with SBP in 80s.

#) Respiratory Status - Patient sustained multiple facial
fractures in the MVA, and required intubation for significant
airway swelling.  During his CCU course, he was gradually weaned
off ventilator support, and he was successfully extubated on
[**2159-6-3**].

#) Sinusitis/Fever - During early hospital course, patient was
persistently febrile and diaphoretic.  In setting of multiple
facial fractures, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic
coverage.  Per ID, patient was on regimen of vancomycin,
aztreonam, cipro, and metronidazole (given penicillin allergy).
No clear source of infection was initially identified, although
it was felt that patient may have develoepd sinusitis in setting
of facial trauma.  CT sinus revealed opacification of sinuses,
however ENT consult did not feel there was any pus, abscess or
fluid collection ammenable to drainage.  The patient's
antibiotic regimen was tailored back to metronidazole and
levofloxacin, for a 14-day course.  He had a PICC placed on
[**2159-6-4**].  The patient was also placed on standing Tylenol during
the time of his persistent fevers.  Prior to discharge, the
patient was off all antibiotics and remained afebrile. He had
1/4 bottles on blood culture positive for coag negative staph,
which was felt to be a contaminant.  Repeat blood cultures were
negative.

#) Facial fractures - Multiple facial fractures noted on CT,
including the bilateral nasal bones, bilateral maxillary sinuses
(anterior, lateral, posterior and medial
walls), the right palatine process of the maxilla and palatine
bone, bilateral
pterygoid plates, bilateral frontal processes of the maxillae,
right lateral
orbital wall and right orbital floor. Blood was present in the
bilateral
maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses and
frontal sinuses.  The globes appeared intact with no evidence of
ocular muscle entrapment.  He was seen by trauma surgery,
plastic surgery, and ophthomology. Plastic surgery irrigated and
sutured facial lacerations in CCU, and ophtho was consulted for
periorbital swelling and orbital fx on CT. They did not feel
there was evidence of entrapment or intraoccular involvement.

#) Asymmetric Pupils - Left pupil noted to be 1-2mm more
constricted than the right, and neurology was consulted.  Both
left and right pupil would constrict to light. Immediate CT scan
could not be obtained secondary to patient's hemodynamic
instability, but CT head once patient medically stable revealed
only a small subdural hematoma.  Ophthomology was [**Name (NI) 653**], and
felt it was highly unlikely any intraocular pathology was
contributing to his asymmetric pupils.

#) Delirium/Agitation - Patient developed agitation and delirium
later in his hospital course, thought to be ICU-related
delirium.  He was seen by psychiatry, and started on a regimen
of olanazpine and mirtazapine.  He also responsed well to
additional olanzapine prn agitation.  He had some difficulty
sleeping, and seemed to respond well to trazadone prn insomnia.
Patient will have neuropsych testing in outpatient setting.

#) Hyperglycemia - The patient had no previous diagnosis of
diabetes, but was persistently hyperglycemic during CCU course,
requiring glargine and an insulin sliding scale.  HbA1c was 6.0.
 He did not tolerate metformin, and was briefly started on
glyburide. However he had some lower blood sugars in the 60s on
glyburide, and this medication was stopped.  He will need close
monitoring of his blood sugar levels following discharge.

#) FEN - The patient was started on tube feeds via OG tube while
he was intubated.  His diet was advanced following his
extubation, and he was tolerating a cardiac healthy regular diet
at time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
54yo m w/metastatic colorectal cancer complicated by multiple
episodes of ascending cholangitis secondary to tumor obstruction
and is s/p several stents who presents with GI bleed and
obstructive jaundice.

1. GI Bleed: Patient's HCT remained relatively stable throughout
the hospital course, and he was seen by the GI team who decided
not to pursue any invasive tests given that he recently had a
coloscopy and gastroscopy both of which were negative. He was
also seen by the stoma nurse who noted that he had some variceal
veins at the edge of his stoma and that could be the cause of
his bleed. Recommended some pressure applications during oozing.
His HCT remained stable, and he was tolerating po well and so it
was decided to hold off on any intervention

2. Obstructive Jaundice: Has had history of multiple cholangitis
secondary to obstruction from his metastatic cancer. Patient
presented jaundiced but did not have any fevers, and no
leukocytosis. Decided to go ahead for ERCP and tolerated the
procedure well. During the procedure, they performed a balloon
sweep and found some hemobilia and pus in his ducts. It was
re-canulated. His LFTs continued to slowly trend down after the
procedure. Given the hemobilia, it was thought that his bleed
could have been secondary to that. To complete a 7 day course of
Levofloxacin.

3. Metastatic colorectal cancer: Known end stage disease and he
is currently DNR/DNI. We had introduced the idea of the
palliative team consult but patient was not interested but the
wife was. Palliative team notified and discussed with wife as
per her request. He also has some abdominal distension but we
decided to hold off on the Lasix given his rise in Creatinine.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Patient's creatinine has been stable
through most of his hospital course but on the day of discharge,
it had bumped to 2.0. Unclear etiology but there was a call from
the lab about ? anicteric sample. A repeat creatinine was
checked and it was found to be 1.5. At that time, his PCP was
notified and made aware, and we informed his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
that we were going to have [**Last Name (STitle) 269**] come out and draw his blood on
Friday and fax him the results of his Creatinine. Case managers
were also notified regarding [**Last Name (STitle) 269**] setup. His Lasix was held
during discharge, and we dosed his antibiotics based on his
renal clearance.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 48 year old male with mental retardation, history of
seizure disorder (unknown etiology, absence type, last [**12-6**]) who
came to medical attention after having a generalized seizure at
his group home.   After his seizure he was taken to OSH, where
VS 103.4, HR 119, BP 68/32 resolving to 102/67 without
intervention, RR 24, O2 Sat 94%  on 1.5 L nasal cannula.  He was
lethargic with diffuse ""maculopapular blanching"" rash.  He was
also noted to be in acute kidney injury with Cr 2.1 with a WBC
count of 8.3 (with 20% bands).  INR was 3.6 (pt on chronic
warfarin for history of DVT *2) and UA, CXR, and CT head were
without acute process.  He received ceftriaxone 2gm, gentamicin
120mg, and fosphenytoin 1000 mg.  As he had what appeared
consistent with a drug rash and was recently started on
treatment for cellulitis with TMP/Sulf he was also presumptively
treated for anyphylactic shock with IM epineprhine, IVF,
methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  He was
then started on dopamine gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS: T 98.9, P 112, BP 126/44, RR 21, O2
92% on 100% non-rebreather mask.  He was quickly weaned off
dopamine.  At that point exam was notable for
delirium/agitation, diffuse erythematous macular rash, edema,
and oral mucosal irritation on the tongue and hard palate with
conjunctival injection.  He received 2-3L LR for hypotension
with CVP in ~14-17 range.  Because he was persistently agitated
he received 2mg lorazepam and 2 mg haloperidol with resulting
sedation then progressive hypoxia requiring intubation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unobtainable as patient initially
unresponsive and then without enough mental status to report.
His mother denied any changes in bowel or bladder habits, known
fevers or chills prior to the day of presentation, complaints of
chest pain, labored breathing, or other complaints.

MICROBIOLOGY
=============
All cultures no growth to date

OTHER RESULTS
==============
ECG [**2193-5-3**]:
Sinus tachycardia. RSR' pattern in lead V1. Reverse anterior R
wave
progression. Clinical correlation is suggested. Non-specific T
wave changes.

Chest Radiograph [**2193-5-3**]:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low and there is elevation of the
right
hemidiaphragm. There are bilateral infiltrates throughout both
lungs central greater than peripheral, it is difficult to assess
the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes secondary to the low
lung volumes and overlying infiltrates.  There is a left
subclavian line with tip in the SVC.

EEG [**2193-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background. This abnormality is suggestive of a
widespread
encephalopathy of medication, metabolic disturbance, or
infection
etiology. Of note is the sinus tachycardia. There were no
lateralized
or epileptiform features seen.

Chest Radiograph [**2193-5-10**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-8**]:
Consolidation in the perihilar right lung and infrahilar left
lung has
improved consistent with resolving pneumonia. There is no good
evidence for
edema. Heart size is top normal, mediastinal vasculature hard to
assess,
pulmonary vessels are minimally engorged. No pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.

Trasnthoracic Echocardiogram [**2193-5-14**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum is not
well visualized (suboptimal views). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is borderline dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old male with past medical history of mental
retardation, seizure disorder and DVT* 2 who presented with a
seizure and mental status changes and was found to have seizure.


1)Meningitis: The patient presented with a seizure, a fever to
103.4, and altered mental status.  He was unable to answer
questions about localizing symptoms.  Meningitis was initially
suspected due to skin rash, though this was more maculopapular
than petechial in nature.  On the first day of his
hospitalization he received vancomycin/ceftriaxone/and
acyclovir, which would be appropriate empiric treatment of a
non-specified meningitis/encephalitis. Unfortunately, due to
difficulties with obtaining an LP, this was not performed until
hospital day three and showed pleiocytosis and increased protein
but was ultimately culture negative.  Ultimately, this was
thought most consistent with partially treated bacterial
meningitis.  Therefore, the patient was treated with
vancomycin/ceftriaxone with resolution of his fevers and
improvement of his mental status to baseline without further
seizures.  Acyclovir was stopped when HSV PCR returned negative.
 The patient will ultimately need to complete fourteen days of
antibiotic therapy for meningitis.

2) Seizure: The patient has a previous history of seizures and
has been on phenytoin.  His previous seizures have not been
grand mal, but this appears to have been the type that occurred
on the day of presentation.  The likely precipitant of this
seizure was the patient's infection and fever, though phenytoin
level was also a bit low.   Initially, he was maintained on IV
phenytoin then fospheynytoin but then transitioned back to his
outpatient PO regimen as mental status resolved.  He never
showed signs of further seizure activity and EEG obtained to
rule out further seizure activity was not consistent with
persistent epileptiform activity.

3) ? Allergic Reaction/Respiratory Failure: The patient had a
presentation of rash, hypotension, and per report swelling of
the throat and tongue.  This could be consistent with acute
allergic reaction and the TMP/Sulfa he had been given for
cellulitis is certainly a potential causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  Still, it
seems unlikely he would react suddenly and this remarkably to
TMP/Sulfa after he had been receiving it for a full day.
Nevertheless, he was treated appropriately for an anaphylactic
reaction with epinephrine, histamine blocker, and steroids and
recovered.

4) Respiratory failure: As stated before it is difficult to tell
if the patient actually had anaphylactic shock leading to airway
compromise and respiratory failure.  Other possible etiologies
would include pulmonary edema given need for vigorous fluid
resuscitation soon after presentation and oversedation in the
emergency departments.  Ultimately, the patient was weaned off
supplementary oxygen without event.

5) Altered mental status: Per the patient's mother at baseline
he has the mental status of a small child with minimal verbal
communication skills but he follows commands and interacts
appropriately. The patient was initially extremely somonolent
and then minimally responsive raising concern for non-convulsive
status epilepticus.  EEG was more consistent with
encephalopathy, however, and the patient's mental status
eventually resolved to baseline with treatment of his underlying
condition and maximization of other variables.  Likely this was
due to toxic-metabolic delirium in the context of severe
infection.

6) History of DVT: The patient has a history of two DVT's and
thus is presumably on lifelong anticoagulation.  His INR was
initially supratherapeutic so further anticoagulation was held
then he was transitioned to low molecular weight heparin for
systemic anticoagulation while he was NPO.  Once he was eating,
warfarin was restarted and LMWH was stopped after 24 hours of
therapeutic INR on coumadin.

7) Non sustained ventricular tachycardia: On the morning of
[**2193-5-13**] the patient had two brief runs of NSVT that broke
without further management.  This was discussed with EP who
thought barring signs of structural heart disease that this
likely had no prognostic significance and was likely simply a
response to acute illness.  The patient had an echocardiogram
that was within normal limits and he had no further episodes of
VT.  Of note this also happened while he was being phenytoin
loaded, which may have contributed to arrythmia.

8) FEN: The patient initially required tube feeds due to altered
mental status and lack of inclination to eat.  He self
discontinued his dobhoff unfortunately and due to a desire to
spare another invasive process if possible he was observed and
thankfully had cleared enough to tolerate PO in around forty
eight hours.  After that he tolerated a full diet with out
incident.

He tolerated a full diet prior to discharge.  All vital signs
were stable and he was afebrile>72 hours.  The patient was full
code.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 60 M w/ end-stage COPD on home O2, CHF and 3
prior suicide attempts who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED s/p witnessed
mechanical fall down one entire flight of stairs after tripping
over his O2 tubing. Per wife and 14 year old son, he was found
with empty bottles of anti-hypertensives and anti-epileptic
medications including proprolol, gabapentin and mirtazipine that
were prescribed to a friend. [**Name (NI) **] had been slurring his words
and walking hunched over all day yesterday after having been out
at night for 3 hours without telling his wife where he was
going. Upon his return, he fell down the stairs after tripping
over his O2 tubing. Per wife who subsequently called 911, he did
not lose consciousness and was able to ask for a tissue prior to
arrival of EMS. He presented to the ED A&Ox1-2 MAE and following
commands. On initial trauma exam, there was no spinal tenderness
and good rectal tone without gross blood. During his ED course,
the pt rapidly deteriorated from a respiratory standpoint and
required intubation to maintain SaO2 > 80s. Pt was a difficult
intubation and aspirated thick olivey liquid in the field, for
which he was treated with CTX/Flagyl. (He had a heavy dinner
consisting of mashed potatoes, meatloaf, a scone and ice cream).
.
CT head/C-spine/torso shwoed injuries c/w C4 pedicle fx, T12/L1
compression fxs and T12 spinous process fractures. He also has R
clavicular fx and R pareital subgaleal hematoma as well as
multiple skin and soft tissue injuries Neurosurgery was
consulted for evaluation of spinal injuries and recommended
C-spine immobilization w/ logroll precautions in place, order
for TLSO brace and MRI C& L-spine w/n 48h to assess ligamentous
injury.

In [**Name (NI) 10115**] pt is intubated and sedated, not following commands as
on propofol but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN was awake and answering questions
appropriately before propofol bolus was given. Per patient's
wife who is in the process of getting divorced from him, he has
had multiple suicide attempts in the past and this was one of
them. His 1st 2 prior attempts were narcotics overdoses and his
3rd was antifreeze ingestion. He apparantly has been having
suicidal ideation since [**2124-10-3**] but exhibited markedly
worsened depressive behaviour over the past few weeks when he
lost his job and filed for bankruptcy. Per wife, they recently
had a meting with their attorney to declare bankruptcy and sell
their house. His wife then told him she wanted to get separated
and they recently looked at rooms for him to move into. She
believes this may have precipitated his recent suicide attempt.

IMAGING:
[**2126-3-22**] CXR: The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral
interstitial opacities. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No pleural
effusions are present.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT Head w/o con: Right subgaleal vertex hematoma. No
intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT C-Spine w/o con:
1. Left left superior articular facet fracture at C4.
2. A small amount of air noted along the PLL at C5 is likely
related to degenerative disc disease. There are disc osteophyte
complexes at C4/5 and C6/7.
3. Retrolisthesis of C4 on C5.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/o con:
1. Compression fractures of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies and
fracture of the T12 spinous process as described above.
2. Fracture of the right distal clavicle (features are
consistent with a chronic finding).
3. Ground-glass opacities in the right upper and middle lobes
and atelectasis and consolidation in right lower lobe could
represent sequelae of aspiration or pneumonia. However, given
the history of trauma, pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
.
[**2126-3-23**] TTE:
The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.
.
[**2126-3-23**] MRI Spine:
1. Mild to moderate compressions of the superior endplate of T12
and L1 without retropulsion or spinal stenosis.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes. Moderate spinal stenosis
seen at L4-5 level and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis seen at
L3-4 level. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 with grade 1
spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1 and foraminal narrowing.
.
[**2126-3-28**] RUE U/S:
1. Superficial thrombophlebitis involving the right cephalic
vein.
2. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the right
subclavian, axillary, or brachial veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
60M w/ COPD, CHF, s/p mechanical fall down a flight of stairs w/
multiple spinous fx, subgaleal hematoma, and difficult
intubation for respiratory failure c/b aspiration event.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ASPIRATION: Patient haS primarily
hypercarbic respiratory failure w/ primary respiratory acidosis
as pH 7.22 PCO2 83 PO2 136 but this is also oxygenation failure
as ABG was on 100% FiO2 so indicates high A-a gradient. Patient
has end-stage COPD and likely has PCO2 in the 60s. Acute
precipitant of respiratory failure is likely toxic ingestion
superimposed on underlying severe lung disease. Upon DL for
intubation, gross food particles evident in airway, thick olive
paste secretions from NG. Marked leukocytosis at 27.3. He was
started on ceftriaxone and flagyl for his presumed aspiration
pneumonia. Sputum cultures grew out GPCs, so he was started on
vancomycin and flagyl was discontinued. He eventually was
switched to vancomycin and cefepime, he eventually concluded a 7
day course. Unfortunately, he developed ARDS and could not be
successfully weaned down on any of his ventilator settings. A
family meeting was held, and the decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only (he was originally DNR, but not
DNI). He was terminally extubated and expired on [**2126-4-6**] at
4:15pm. The medical examiner accepted the case for review.
.
# FEVERS: His temperature started to spike on HD #2. His
antiobiotics were broadened and he was repeatedly pan-cultured.
With these, he was found to have c diff + stool. He was treated
with oral vancomycin and iv flagyl. He continued to periodically
spike fevers during the course of his stay, in spite of
treatment with antibiotics. As above he was eventually made CMO
and terminally extubated.
.
# SPINAL TRAUMA: T12 and L1 compression fractures with fracture
of the T12 spinous process as well as Left pedicle fracture at
C4 w/ retrolisthesis of C4 on C5. Neurosurgery evalutated the
patient, but no surgical intervention. [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar applied
and TLSO brace were applied whenever he was >30.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: He has episodes of atrial fibrillation
with RVR during his hospital stay which were generally well
controlled with diltiazem.
.
# ATTEMPTED SUICIDE: Unclear what medications the patient took
and if it clearly was a suicide attempt. U tox was negative.
Patient does have history of multiple past suicide attempts and
he has been increasingly depressed recently. Intent was to set
him up with psychiatry, social work, however patient was made
CMO and expired.
.
# HYPERKALEMIA: He was newly hyperkalemic upon presentation at
6.2, likely secondary to acute kidney injury. An EKG was done
w/no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. This resolved with
resuscitation.
.
The patient was maintained on a ppi for Gi prophylaxis,
pneumoboots and subcutaneous heparin while he was in the
hospital. He was given tube feedings for nutrition. Eventually,
the decision was made by his health care proxy and his entire
family after an extensive family meeting to make the patient
comfort measures only. He was terminally extubated, made
comfortable with scopolamine and fentanyl. He expired on [**2126-4-6**]
at 4:15pm. The medical examiner was contact[**Name (NI) **] given that the
death involved a trauma and a possible suicide attempt. The ME
accepted the case for review.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Placement of 2 pleurex catheters


History of Present Illness:
86F history of DM2, HTN, HLD, cardiac problem, transferred from
[**Name (NI) **]. Pt presented with one month of breathing difficulty,
weight loss, cough, decreased apetite getting progressively
worse over time. Family trie to bring pt in earlier but she
refused to go to hospital. Last night pt became acute more SOB
and family called ambulance and pt brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. At
[**Hospital1 **] found to have WBC 44, HR 170's in A fib, lactate=4;
concern for possible malignant process and ? PE. Got dilt 30mg
PO and 10mg IV for HR, which improved. Also got 4L IVF. LENI
showed R DVT. Got head CT which showed nothing acute. Deferred
CTA chest due to elevated Cr (Cr 1.8). Started on heparin gtt
for DVT and concern for PE. Got azithro and ceftriaxone at
[**Hospital1 **].
During transport pt developed worsened rales/crackles possibly
secondary to 4 L IVF given.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: 65, RR 32, 128/59, 97% 15L
NRB. ECG showed AFib with RVR. Patient was started on a nitro
gtt, heparin gtt, given vancomycin/zosyn, and placed on BiPAP
for resp distress which didnt tolerate. Labs were notable for a
lactate of 8.5, WBC count 49.3, INR 1.6 and Cr of 1.8. CXR: air
fluid level abscess in lung. Patient was initially trialed on
BiPAP, did not tolerate, and thus was intubated (straight
forward intubation).
Placed R IJ. CVP=13.
Lactate rose to 10 and concern for gut ischemia.
CTA chest and torso: No PE, revealed multiple abscess in L lung-
Rim enhancing fluid collection. Multiple hypodensisities in
kidney and liver suggestive of embolic infectious process.
in ED given: Vanco, zosyn, flagyl.
Thoracics consult: Poor surgical candidate. Recc drainage per IR
right now.
K=6-->insulin/D50, Kayexlate.
Gave 1 UPRBC for elevated lactate.
ED attempted to call family several times to give update, never
got through.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated, sedated, on Levo 0.2
and Dopamine 8. Had family meeting with son and 3 grandchildren.
Family very tearful, as of now they request FULL code but will
continue to discuss goals of care. They report this pt is usualy
active at baseline, ambulatory, takes care of her great
grandchildren.

Correlate with microbiology report.

ECG Study Date of [**2162-3-29**]  2:29:44 AM
The rhythm is regular and most likely a junctional escape rhythm
at 60 beats per minute without clear atrial activity. Delayed R
wave transition. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Possible prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2162-3-29**] 2:45 AM
FINDINGS:

There is extensive opacification of the left hemithorax with an
air-fluid
level identified superiorly. These findings are representative
of a large
mass, possibly abscess in a fissure. Less likely would be a
large hiatal
hernia. There is rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Otherwise, the right hemithorax appears clear. No acute
fractures are identified. A dedicated chest CT is recommended
for further evaluation

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2162-3-29**] at 12:03:01 PM      FINAL

The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2162-3-29**] 3:05 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Multilobulated large left hemithorax pleural empyema with
foci of gas
noted. Given the foci of gas the differential includes recent
instrumentation
versus infection with a gas-forming organism versus a
bronchopleural fistula.

2. Multiple hypodense areas are also visualized throughout
bilateral
nonenlarged kidneys. These findings may be representative of
multiple cysts but a superinfectious process with multiple
abscesses cannot be excluded.

3. Small subsegmental right upper lobe pulmonary emboli.

4. There is mild gallbladder wall edema and mottled apparance of
the liver
are likely due to congestive hepatopathy.

5. Endotracheal tube with the tip at the level of the carina.
Retraction by
2cm is recommended.

6. Bilateral small pleural effusions.

7 . Severe cardiomegaly.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2162-3-31**] 2:17 AM
FINDINGS: The left pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.
The right IJ
and ET tubes terminate in the standard position. The NG tube
terminates
outside the field of view. Compared to [**3-30**], there are
increasing
bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular congestion, and
parenchymal opacities suggesting developing pulmonary edema.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Tere is no pneumothorax.

Findings were discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by
phone at 11:45
a.m. on [**2162-3-31**].

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2162-3-31**] 9:08 AM
IMPRESSION:
Interval resolution of a dominant gas/fluid collection within
the left
hemithorax, and near-resolution of an adjacent medial
collection. There remains a loculated posterior collection that
does not appear tocommunicate  with the catheter. 2. Adjacent
severe left lower lobe atelectasis with a consolidative
component. Slightly enlarged small right pleural effusion.
Trace pericardial effusion. New moderate anasarca. Increased
caliber of the main pulmonary artery likely reflects chronic
 pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT Torso [**4-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Reaccumulation of left sided localized hydropneumothorax s/p
pigtail
catheter removal.
2. Bilateral peribronchial ground glass opacity and patchy
opacities which
are a non-specific finding.
3. Slight decrease in size of right pleural effusion.
4. Stable increased diameter of the main pulmonary artery likely
due to
pulmonary hypertension.
5. Persistent non-mobile 1.3cm filling defect within the left
main bronchus which is suspicious for polyp, neoplasm or mucus
plug.
.
CT Chest [**4-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mid-esophageal soft tissue mass severly narrows and may
invade left main bronchus.
2. Interval placement of a second left lower lung drain with
interval
decrease in size of the air and fluid collection. Persistent
left lower lung consolidation is either pneumonia or
atelectasis.
3. Markedly enlarged right atrium.
4. Thinning of the renal cortices with hyperdensity which could
represent
retained contrast or nephrocalcinosis.
.
ECHO [**4-6**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet
of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2162-3-29**], the degree of TR and pulmonary
hypertension have increased.
..

INDICATIONS: 86-year-old female with esophageal cancer, lung
empyema and
ischemic right foot.

Bilateral lower extremity ABIs, Doppler waveforms, and PVRs were
performed at
rest.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT: The right ABI is 0.65 at DP. There is no signal present
at PT.
Doppler waveforms are biphasic to the level of the popliteal
artery.
Posterior tibial waveform is absent. The dorsalis pedis waveform
is
monophasic. PVRs are artifactually diminished proximally and
aphasic at the
metatarsal level suggesting severe tibial disease.

The left ABI is 0.61 at DP. The PT waveform is absent.
Left-sided Doppler
waveforms are triphasic at the popliteal level and monophasic at
the dorsalis
pedis. PVRs show significant dropoff between calf and ankle and
again between
ankle and metatarsal level suggesting severe tibial occlusive
disease.

IMPRESSION: ABIs are likely falsely elevated. Based on Doppler
waveforms and
PVRs, there is severe tibial disease bilaterally.
.

COMPARISON: CT [**4-4**] and [**2162-4-6**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT data were acquired through the chest without
intravenous
contrast. Images were displayed in multiple planes.

FINDINGS: There are two pigtail catheters at the left lung base.
A
small-to-moderate effusion layers posteriorly. There is no large
air-fluid
collection in communication with the anterior or posterior
drain. Moderate
left basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation is unchanged. A
moderate right
effusion is slightly larger.

No new consolidation, nodule, or pneumothorax is present. Since
the prior
exam, an esophageal catheter has been removed. The boundaries of
a large mid
esophageal mass are hard to delineate without contrast. The
lesion measures
approximately 1.9 x 3.4 cm (2:20). Since the preceding exam five
days ago,
the left main bronchus has become completely effaced (2:20) by a
combination
of mass effect from the thickened esophagus, and bronchial
secretions. There
are extensive secretions in the distal left lower lobe segmental
bronchus at
(2:25). A tracheo-esophageal connection is not directly
visualized but would
not be suprising given the appearence.

The non-contrast appearance of the heart and great vessels shows
cardiomegaly,
massive right atrial enlargment, and minimal aortic arch
calcification. The
tip of a right subclavian line terminates in the low SVC. The
thyroid has
normal attenuation. No mesenteric, hilar or axillary adenopathy
is present.
There is residual renal excretion of contrast from [**3-29**].
There are
peripheral hyperdense foci in the visualized portions of both
kidneys.
Previously, the cortices of both kidneys were uniformly
hyperdense.

Residual oral contrast is seen in nondistended loops of large
bowel.

BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are no concerning lytic or
sclerotic lesions.
Bilateral lower old rib fractures. There is diffuse soft tissue
edema.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large mid esophageal soft tissue mass with now complete
opacification of
the left main bronchus either by invasion, hemorrhage, and/or
secretions.
Persistent post-obstructive left lower lobe consolidation and
bronchial
secretions.
2. Improving small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. No large
collection at
the site of two pigtail catheters.
3. Increasing moderate right effusion.
4. Stable right atrial enlargement.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Query pneumothorax, 86-year-old woman with large
esophageal
neoplasm extending into the left mainstem.

TECHNIQUE: Portable upright chest view was read in comparison
with multiple
prior radiographs with the most recent from [**2162-4-13**].

FINDINGS:

Lower lung opacity due to a combination of effusion and
atelectasis now
involves the entire left hemithorax suggestive of an increased
large left
pleural effusion. Two pleural pigtail catheters in the left
lower hemithorax
are unchanged in position. Increase in the left pleural
effusion. There has
not been much change in the position of the mediastinum probably
due to
associated left lung volume loss. Moderate right pleural
effusion and right
basilar atelectasis is similar. Upper lung is clear.

IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion has progressed over last two
days. Two
left pleural pigtail catheters are in unchanged position and
moderate right
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F with no known medical problems admitted shortness and
breath cough. Hospital course was notable for admission to the
ICU where she was found to have lung and renal abscesses, septic
shock requiring vasopressor support, DVT and PE, and difficult
to control atrial fibrillation. She was also noted to have a
large esophageal mass suggestive of esophageal cancer with
compression of the left main stem bronchus causing intermittent
lung collapse and esophageal compression with
dysphagia/aspiration. Patient had a long ICU course and
transferred from the floor to the ICU multiple times.
Ultimately, given the patient's multiple significant and severe
medical problems, age, and progressively declining course
despite maximal medical care, a discussion was held with the
family and the decision was to transition the patient's care to
comfort centered care and the patient passed away [**2162-4-19**] at
2:10AM.

#Septic shock/Lung and renal abscesses:
Patient presented in septic shock from pneumonia with empyema
and was found to have lung and renal abscesses. She required
multiple pressors and intubation. Her lactate peaked at 10. CT
demonstrated multiple fluid collections as well as an esophageal
mass (see below) that was compressing the L mainstem bronchus
that was believed to be predisposing to her polymicrobial
infection. Interventional pulmonology placed two chest tubes to
drain the fluid collections. Gram stain showed GPCs, GNRs and
gram positive rods. Cultures only grew strep angionosis. She was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but was weaned
down to vancomycin and flagyl per ID recommendations for a
planned course of four weeks from the date of her last chest
tube placement (day one [**4-5**]). She was weaned off pressors and
succesfully extubated. She was treated with vanc/flagyl until
she was made CMO on [**2162-4-16**].

#DVT/PE: Patient was found to have DVT on lower extremity
ultrasound. CTA showed small subsegmental RLL PE. Patient was
placed on heparin gtt. After her goals of care discussion
anticoagulation was held on [**2162-4-16**].

#Esophageal Mass, likely esophageal cancer, with bronchial and
esophageal obstruction:
CT showed large  mid esophageal soft tissue mass with now
complete opacification of the left main bronchus either by
invasion, hemorrhage, and/or secretions.
There was persistent post-obstructive left lower lobe
consolidation and bronchial secretions and patient did suffer
collapse of her left lung. It was believed that this mass was
the etiology of her polymicrobial septic shock, as well as
persistent pleural effusions and left sided atelectatsis.
Secondary to the obstruction of the esophagus and risks for
aspiratoin, the patient was made NPO. She did transiently
receive TPN, but this was discontinued when care was
transitioned to comfort centered care.

#Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has history of afib,
but this was likely exacerbated or caused by infection/sepsis.
There may also have been contribution of irritation by
esophageal mass. After hypotension resolved patient was managed
on the medical floor with IV betablockers but required transfer
back to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation and low blood
pressures in the 90s. She was subsequently rate controlled with
IV amiodarone drip in the ICU and transferred back to the
medical floor. After family discussion regarding overall goals
of care amiodarone was eventually discontinued.

# Acute Renal failure: Creatinine 1.8 with unclear baseline. Her
creatinine later increased to a peak of 2.8 which was believed
to be ATN from septic shock. Her creatinine trended back down to
1.8. On the floor  her creatinine remained at baseline.

# Anemia: She required 3 UPRBC in setting of elevated lactate
and septic shock. Hct stabilzed in mid 30s.

#Goals of care discussion:
Throughout hospitalization multiple family meetings/updates were
held with multiple providers/teams. Palliative care was involved
as were the social work and case management teams. With the
patient's age of >80 years and multiple medical problems that
continued to progress despite medical care (including IV
amiodarone drip, TPN, antibiotics, and IV anticoagulation), the
family decided to focus on comfort centered care on [**2162-4-16**]. The
patient passed away on [**2162-4-19**] at 2AM.

History of Present Illness:
46F xfer from OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) after being found down by
VNA earlier today. Recent hosp admission for UTI, Klebsiella PNA
completed antibiotics and discharged home. History is unclear,
however [**Location (un) **] reports that she is on the liver transplant
list. History of rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis
on Florinef. Outside hospital, patient was intubated for her
unresponsiveness. Received vancomycin and Zosyn. Also noted to
have a left hip dislocation that was reduced in the ER.
Hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine after 2 L of IV fluids.
Transferred for further care. PH 7.1, CO2 50 with a bicarbonate
of 18 on initial ABG. At outside hospital, attempted right and
left IJ resulted in subcutaneous fluid extravasation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals she recieved hydrocortisone 100 mg IV
because chronically on florinef and had a right femoral CVL
placed.  Also, she underwent a CT head which was negative for
acute bleed and a CT torso which showed bilateral aspiration
versus effusions.  Her hip had to be reduced twice, once with
vecuronium.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was intubated and sedated with
initial vital signs 88/69, 120, 14, 100% on AC (volume).
.

IMAGING:
[**12-7**] CT C/A/P: TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from
the chest, abdomen and pelvis with the administration of IV
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
CT OF THE CHEST: Right pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. Left base opacification likely represents collapsed
left lower lobe which appears airless and filled with higher
density material, possibly blood. The patient has a nasogastric
tube which passes into the stomach. ETT tube appears
approximately 4.7cm above the carina.
The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature
and
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] solid organs are incompletely evaluated in the
absence of IV contrast. Within this limitation, the liver,
pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Note
is made of splenomegaly. Both kidneys show no evidence of large
masses. A non-obstructive 9-mm stone is noted within the lower
pole of the left kidney (601B, 32). Small stones are noted
within the right kidney. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.
Surgical sutures are noted in the RLQ, otherwise,
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] loops of
large and small bowel appear unremarkable. There is no free air
or free fluid within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
The structures within the pelvis are incompletely evaluated due
to the
presence of streak artifact due to bilateral total hip
replacements. Within this limitation, the patient is status post
a Foley catheter. A right femoral vein catheter is identified. A
possible rectal catheter is noted. Bilateral hip prosthesis are
noted; the right femoral component appears well seated within
the acetabular component; however, the left femoral component is
not well seated within the left acetabular component.
Decrease in vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body is noted
with possible retropulsion of fragment into the spinal canal and
indentation of the thecal sac. This is of indeterminate
chronicity, but likely represents more chronic process with the
presence of what looks like kyphoplasty material within L1
vertebral body. Intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature is not well
evaluated in the absence of contrast technique.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Left base
opacification likely represents collapsed left lower lobe which
appears
airless and filled with higher density material, possibly blood.

2. Left lower pole renal calculus.
3. Incomplete evaluation of the pelvis due to streak artifact.
4. Left total hip arthroplasty prosthesis shows femoral
component is not well seated within the acetabular component.
5. Loss of vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body with
possible
retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal; this is of
indeterminate
chronicity, however, appears to be chronic due to presence of
what appears to be kyphoplastic material.
.
[**12-7**] CT HEAD:TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained
through the head without the administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
There is no evidence of acute fracture or traumatic dislocation.
Bilateral
mastoid air cells are clear. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted
within
bilateral maxillary sinuses.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete
masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence
of large acute major vascular territory infarction.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is marked anterior rotation
of the
odontoid process relative to a thickened appearance of the body
of C2. The
finding likely represents a fracture/subluxation deformity.
There is resultant prominent central canal narrowing at this
level. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this
locale. It is possible that the finding represents a prior,
healed fracture, but clearly this question must be resolved,
through either obtaining prior records/imaging studies
immediately, and/or subsequent spinal CT imaging. In the
meantime, the patient's neck needs to be stabilized.
.
[**12-8**] CT CSPINE: COMPARISON: CT head from [**2160-12-7**] and
portable C-spine radiograph from [**2160-12-7**].

TECHNIQUE: Helical 2.5-mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from
the skull
base through the level of T2. Sagittal and coronal reformations
were obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is a large mass of new bone formation causing
fusion of the C1 and C2 vertebral bodies anteriorly, with
anterior subluxation of C1 with respect to C2(400b:27). This
results in severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the
posterior arch of C1. The degree of subluxation is unchanged
from the prior study. There is no fracture identified.
There is extensive fusion of every facet joint from C2 to T3,
comprising all the levels imaged. There is also interbody fusion
involving every cervical level. There has been surgical anterior
fusion at C6-7. There is extensive fusion of the lamina and
interlaminar ligaments throughout the visualized levels. In the
portion of thoracic spine included in the study, there is fusion
of costovertebral and costotransverse articulations. Comparison
with a torso CT of [**2160-12-8**] reveals similar ankylosis in the
lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. These findings indicate a
spondyloarthropathy with manifestations typical of ankylosing
spondylitis. Correlation with the remainder of her medical
history will be helpful.

IMPRESSION:
1. Anterior subluxation of C1 on C2 without evidence of
fracture. The
anterior arch of C1 is fused to the odontoid process via a thick
layer of bone that contributes to the subluxation. This produces
severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of
C1.
2. There are extensive fusions of multiple spinal joints most
suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.
3. No evidence of acute fracture.
.
[**12-7**] PELVIS PLAIN FILM: Comparison is made to selected images
from an [**Month/Day (4) 1676**] pelvic CT scan dated [**2160-12-7**].

SINGLE PORTABLE AP PELVIC FILM WAS OBTAINED [**2160-12-7**] AT 0452:
Bilateral total hip replacements are seen. The femoral and
acetabular
components appear to be well approximated on this single AP
view. The distal end of both femoral components is not included
on the image. There is no evidence of loosening of the femoral
components. Hypertrophic bone is seen lateral to the right
femoral component. A right femoral catheter is in place. No
displaced fracture of the pelvis is appreciated. Surgical chain
sutures are seen in the right lower quadrant, suggesting prior
colonic surgery. A Foley catheter is in place. Several
radiopaque densities are seen lateral to the left femoral
component within the soft tissues which may be sutural in
etiology. Clinical correlation is advised.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral total hip replacements with both appearing to be
normally positioned on this single portable view. No evidence of
displaced fracture of the pelvis.

Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within one of two paired
brachial veins, which extends to the axillary vein.

Portable chest x-ray [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent sizable parenchymal infiltrate in left
lower lobe
area. No new abnormalities in this portable chest examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 40984**] is a 46 year old female with a history of suicide
attempts and subsequent liver disease, multiple infections
including ESBL Klebsiella and osteomyelitis who takes chronic
steroids for ankylosis spondylitis presented from an outside
hospital intubated and requiring pressors.
.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE:
# Acute metabolic acidosis without respiratory compensation:
Her pH upon admission to ICU was 7.1 with a bicarb of 14, later
worsened to 7.09 with bicarb of 12.  The possible etiologies of
her primary metabolic acidosis include intoxication versus
sepsis.  The active [**Doctor Last Name 360**]/s seem to have suppressed her
respiratory drive (additional respiratory acidosis) as well as
causing a primary metabolic acidosis.  She was treated with IV
fluids with bicarbonate as well as hyperventilation on
mechanical ventilation in order to improve the acidosis and
elevated pCO2.  Also, the toxicology and psychiatry services
were consulted to assist with identifying the cause of her
ingestion.  Finally, she was started empirically on
piperacillin/tazobactam with vancomycin to cover for possible
aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: She was intubated upon arrival but able
to be ventilated well including a recruitment procedure to open
her atelectatic lung seen on CT.  She was extubated easily and
did well on room air afterwards.  As discussed above, it was
thought that she aspirated while she was impaired from an
unknown ingestion.  Her CT chest was consistent with some small
bilateral pneumonia.  Following stabilization and extubation,
induced sputum results returned positive for MRSA.  She
completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.  She remained afebrile
throughout remainder of course on the medical floor.  PICC was
discontinued prior to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
# Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive on admission to ICU.  Her
hypotension is of unclear etiology.  It seems possible that she
had sepsis--likely from pneumonia.  Also, she may have been down
long enough to miss her home florinef dose, resulting in
hypotension.  Lastly, the ingestion itself could have caused
hypotension.  She was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics as
above, and stress doses of steroids.  Blood pressures were
stable during floor course.  She was started on captopril when
she became hypertensive with subsequent good control.
.
# Psychologic issues:  We suspect that she had a purposeful
ingestion with suicidal attempt.  Blood tox was positive for
benzos and tricyclics.  Urine tox was positive for benzos,
cocaine, and opiates.  However, the patient did not admit
suicide ideation; she intermittently reported that she may have
accidentally ingested more medications than intended. Psychiatry
was consulted and they recommended a 1:1 sitter.  She was placed
on section 12.  She was followed by psychiatry and often refused
full interviewing.  She did not admit to suicide ideation but
given her prior suicide attempts and depression with inability
to care for herself, she was transferred to psych facility for
further care.  All of her psychiatric medications were held
during hospital stay.  She was started on low dose seroquel on
the floor prior to transfer to help with sleep.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis:  Her admission Creatinine was 2.2 (baseline is
< 1.0) with phosphate >7 and CK of [**Numeric Identifier 24587**].  She was treated with
IV fluids and alkalinization of the urine (with bicarb).  Her
creatinine improved to baseline and her CK trended down quickly.
.
# Transaminitis:  She has a history of liver disease secondary
to toxic ingestions.  Her AST/ALT ratio suggests EtOH damage.
APAP < 2 at OSH.  LFTs normalized by time of [**Numeric Identifier **].
.
# Odontoid fracture and Hip dislocation:  Patient originally
arrived in the ED with dislocated hip which was reduced.
However, while intubated she awoke and again dislocated her hip
while agitated.  It has been put in a brace after a second
reduction.  Her CT head showed an old odontoid fracture,
confirmed with CT neck.  She was kept immobilized until cleared
by ortho spine team.  For her hip, ortho recommended that she
continue with posterior hip precautions.  She is weight bearing
as tolerated.
.
# Left upper extremity DVT:  Patient failed bilateral internal
jugular central lines in the outside hospital and then failed a
left subclavian and left IR-guided PICC here.  Imaging looks
like there is some type of central obstruction, L
brachiocephalic vein no flow past it on venogram.  She was
eventually able to get a midline at level of axillary.
Ultrasound showed left upper extremity DVT.  She was initially
started on heparin gtt with coumadin.  She was then transitioned
to lovenox with coumadin.  INR was therapeutic for several days
between 2 and 3 by time of [**Numeric Identifier **] on 3mg of warfarin daily.
Pt currently is at risk of falling (due to her ankylosing
spondylitis and hip dislocations) and syncope from substance
abuse.  However, given that she will be transferred to an
extended care facility, it was felt that benefits of
anticoagulation would outweigh the risks at this time. When
ready for [**Numeric Identifier **], there should be another discussion of
anticoagulation.   After rehabilitation from both physical and
mental viewpoint, risks/benefits of anticoagulation should be
re-assessed.  In the meantime, fall precautions should be
continued at psych facility
.
# Diarrhea: Pt had several loose BMs daily.  C.diff was negative
x 2.  Given amount of diarrhea, she was empirically started on
oral flagyl 500mg TID.  C.diff PCR was sent in the meantime.
PCR returned negative and flagyl was discontinued.  She was
started on immodium with symptomatic relief
.
# Tinea corporis: Pt had several macular patches on lower back
and right leg with central clearing.  This was consistent with
tinea corporis.  She was treated with clotrimazole cream [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Pain control: Pt with longstanding history of narcotic use.
She frequently demanded IV dilaudid for nonspecific complaints,
including [**Hospital1 1676**] pain.  Also has ankylosing spondylitis, left
hip dislocation, and left hand IV infiltration of levophed from
OSH that can contribute to pain. Pain consult obtained who
recommended maintaining current narcotic regimen of oral
dilaudid q6h.  She was also given lidoderm patch and ibuprofen
for pain relief. Oral dilaudid was transitioned to oral
oxycodone prior to [**Hospital1 **] which patient reported was more
satisfactory.

[**Hospital1 **] Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were
admitted after being found in your home unconscious.  You were
intubated and in the ICU.  You likely had an ingestion that
caused you to lose consciousness.  You will be transferred to a
psychiatric facility where you will continue to receive mental
health care.

During your hospital stay, you were treated for pneumonia with
an IV antibiotic; you finished this course.

You were also started on a blood thinner called coumadin for a
blood clot found in your left arm.  You will need to have levels
of this medication in your blood monitored 2-3 times weekly.
After psychiatric and physical rehabilitation, the risks and
benefits of blood thinners should be revisited so that we can
determine how long you should stay on this medication.

Please see attached sheet for your new medications.

Followup Instructions:
You will be seen by psychiatrists and physicians at your
facility.

History of Present Illness:
On admission to medical floor:
This is a 83 yo M with HTN, HLD, AAA 5.7cm and recent
hospitalization for diverticulosis initially presenting with
cough and SOB.  On [**10-21**], patient experienced significant DOE,
even when walking across the room.  He went to [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**10-23**] for evaluation where a V/Q scan showed poor perfusion
in the RLL and CXR suggested RLL PNA.  He received azithro, CTX,
and some lasix and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].  Upon presentation, he had
no focal lung sounds, was talking in full sentences, but was
tired out by moving.  Bedside echo showed no effusion or
ventricular collapse.  An EKG showed TWI V1, V3, unchanged from
previous.  A repeat CXR was unimpressive and not suggestive of
PNA.  Trop was elevated to 0.16, creatinine was 3.6 (unknown
baseline).  He was started on a heparin drip and received vanco
1g to supplement OSH Abx.  CT w/o contrast was performed showing
hyperdense material in the right main pulmonary artery extending
in the segmental branches, concerning for large pulmonary
embolus with mild enlargement of right cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] raising
concern for possible right heart strain.  No TPA was
administered.  LENIs showed extensive RLE DVT and thrombus in
the posterior tibial vein in the LLE.  Echo showed moderately
dilated RV with free wall hypokinesis.  Retrievable IVC filter
was placed on [**10-24**].  Patient's creatinine rose on [**10-25**] with
concern for low UOP and patient was bolused.
.
Patient reports no recent immobilization or travel, no
malignancy, and no history of clots in his family.  He has had
no previous clots that he knows of.
.
Currently, patient reports improved dyspnea, no chest pain, no
current cough, no fever or chills.  He successfully got up to
the chair to eat lunch today.  He reports no leg pain and has
noted no swelling.
.
ROS: as above, no dysuria, no diarrhea, no PND, no orthopnea, no
productive cough, no joint pains, no numbness or weakness, no
sinus tenderness.

Labs on discharge:

Micro studies:
Blood cultures [**2118-10-23**]: negative x 2
MRSA screen [**10-23**]: negative

Ancillary tests:
CXR on admission [**10-23**]:
Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomegaly. Otherwise,
unremarkable study.
.
CT chest w/o contrast [**10-23**]:
1. Hyperdense material in the right main pulmonary artery
extending in the
segmental branches, concerning for large pulmonary embolus with
mild
enlargement of right cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] raising concern for
possible right heart strain.  Findings were urgently discussed
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 10 p.m. on [**2118-10-23**], by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 10304**].
2. Emphysema.
3. Bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis, with subtle ground-glass
opacities at the lower lobes and area of ground glass opacity in
lingula, could suggest incipient atelectasis; however, cannot
exclude infectious disease involving lower airways.
4. Several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Followup CT chest in
6 to 12
months is recommended to document stability, if clinically
warranted.
5. Atherosclerotic changes at the SMA, with proximal dilatation
of SMA which indirectly could suggest stenosis at the origin of
SMA although suboptimal evaluation due to lack of IV contrast.
.
TTE [**2118-10-24**]:
Moderately dilated right ventricle with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and
global systolic function (LVEF 55-60%). Dilated ascending aorta.

.
Bilateral lower extremity U/S [**2118-10-24**]:
Extensive right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis as above
and thrombus also seen in the posterior tibial vein on the left.
.
CXR [**2118-10-26**]:
In comparison with the study of [**10-23**], there is probably little
overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with
opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and
effusion. The overall appearance is somewhat worsened due to the
low lung volumes. No
evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Blunting of
the right
costophrenic angle persists.

CXR postintubation [**11-4**]
there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube ending
4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is new with the tip
in the
stomach. A right internal jugular catheter projects over the mid
SVC. Right
pleural effusion is stable. Increased opacification at the left
lung base
represents worsening atelectasis and effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are stable.

TTE [**11-4**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2118-10-24**], the right ventriclre is less dilated and
less hypocontractile.

Pan CT [**2118-11-5**]
1. Diffuse panproctocolonic wall thickening with pericolonic
edema concerning for a pancolitis. Differential includes
infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic etiologies. Per discussion
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1833**], the patient currently has a
Clostridium difficile infection and these findings are in
keeping withthis diagnosis.
2. Increased left basilar consolidation, concerning for interval
development of pneumonia.
3. Abdominal ascites particularly adjacent to the spleen, liver
and paracolic gutters.
4. Large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87816**] was an 83 year old man with hypertension,
dyslipidemia and a 5.7cm AAA who, in the week prior to his
planned AAA repair had a diverticular bleed and shortly
thereafter developed a large PE in his right PA that caused
hypoxia and right heart strain. He was diagnosed and monitored
in the MICU on heparin, slowly transitioning from NRB to nasal
canula for oxygen. He did well and while his right heart strain
improved, he developed severe, complicated c.difficile colitis
with recalcitrant shock and ventillatory needs that required
intubation. He ultimately passed on [**11-4**].
.
#. Acute pulmonary embolus/bilateral deep venous thromboses -
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from an outside
hospital for hypoxia and a V/Q scan that illustrated a right
lung filling defect.  After admission, noncontrast CT was
obtained and showed a large pulmonary embolus in the right lung
vasculature.  Patient was started on a heparin drip, with
warfarin shortly afterwards.  IV heparin was stopped 24 hours
after therapeutic INR was achieved.  Bilateral ultrasounds of
the lower extremities were performed and showed. Upon reaching
the medicine floor, the patient remained on 6 liters of O2 by
nasal cannula, on one occasion requiring a face mask for
desaturation below 90%, from which he quickly recovered.
.
# Hypoxia: patient was consistently hypoxic during his time on
the medical floor, with likely contributing factors being his
clot burden and underlying emphysema.  Before being transferred
to the medical floor from the ICU, the patient was taken off a
non-rebreather mask and placed on nasal cannula.  Patient was
provided albuterol inhalers and nebulizer treatments, as well as
ipratropium inhalers around the clock to optimize respiratory
status.  Albuterol treatments were discontinued after the
patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation.  He worked
with physical therapy and slowly improved for a period of time
from an oxygenation standpoint.  On [**2118-11-3**], patient was noted
to be tachypneic to the 30s-low 40s, with oxygen saturations
dropping from low 90s to 87-89% on 6 liter of O2.  A trigger was
called.  Physical exam showed rales present, mostly in the left
lung.  A dose of Lasix was administered due to concern for fluid
overload after continuous IV fluid administration due to the
patient's elevated creatinine at the time.  A non-rebreather was
placed with improvement in oxygen saturations to the mid-90s and
improvement in respiratory rate. Patient was given nebulizer
treatment and 20 mg IV Lasix. ABG was performed with pH 7.45,
pCO2 30, pO2 61 on 6 liters of oxygen. Chest X-ray was ordered
and showed no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or
pneumonia, but had signs of worsened atelectasis and pleural
effusion as compared to a previous X-ray on [**11-2**], when the
patient first developed a leukocytosis.  Urine and blood
cultures were ordered after the patient spiked a fever to 101 F,
and the patient was started on IV cefepime and vancomycin
empirically.  He was transferred to the MICU.
.
#. Clostridium difficile colitis: on [**2118-11-2**], patient began
developing numerous episodes of diarrhea along with
leukocytosis, and testing for Clostridium difficile was ordered.
 A positive result returned on [**2118-11-3**] and the patient was begun
on PO flagyl for treatment. Later on that day, it was decided to
switch the patient's treatment to IV flagyl as well as PO
vancomycin for likely severe C. difficile infection. Despite
antibiotic therapy, the patient continued to fare poorly with
this infection. He went into septic shock. On [**11-5**] a
central line and arterial line were placed for rescusitation.
Vasopressors were begun. Unable to keep up with the work of
breathing, Mr. [**Known lastname 87816**] was intubated on the AM of [**11-4**]. He was
transfused one unit of pRBCs to preserve oxygenation but
remained on large doses of vasopressors. In the early AM of
[**11-5**], his blood pressure became untenable on neosynephrine and
he became increasingly dependent on 3 pressors. A CT torso was
obtained that showed severe colitis with few other positive
findings. His family was called to the bedside and he passed at
6am on [**11-5**].
.
#. Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease: given an
equivocal results of FEUrea, likely etiology was prerenal
failure with progression to acute tubular necrosis.  Urinalysis
was performed and was non-revealing.  The patient's baseline
creatinine was 3.  Nephrotoxins were avoided and patient's
medications were renally dosed.  Patient was kept at even fluid
balance.  On [**2118-11-3**], his creatinine began to rise in
conjunction with the numerous episodes of diarrhea that the
patient began to experience found to be due to Clostridium
difficile infection.  IV fluids were administered until the time
of hypoxia leading to his MICU transfer.
.
#. Urinary retention: the patient developed urinary retention
during his hospitalization which was thought to possibly be due
to the addition of trazodone to help with sleep, or from some
constipation that the patient developed during his hospital
course.  There was no known history of prostate disease, and
rectal exam performed on the medical floor revealed no
nodularity or enlargement of the prostate, and patient was
guaiac negative.  A Foley catheter had to be placed due to
urinary retention and trazodone was discontinued, but urine
retention did not resolve at the time of transfer to the MICU.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: patient was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation on [**2118-10-29**], with possible precipitants being his
pulmonary process, perhaps mild dehydration and the result of
his beta-blocker being held.  Patient was started on metoprolol
for rate control which was uptitrated until regular rate was
achieved.  He was already on anticoagulation for his pulmonary
embolism and deep venous thromboses.  The patient was monitored
on telemetry throughout the rest of his time on the hospital
floor, and was maintained in sinus rhythm.
.
#. Anemia: Patient was anemic upon presentation with guaiac
negative stools.  Active type and screen with crossmatched units
of blood were maintained.  Vitamin B12 and folate were checked,
with a noted low vitamin B12 level.  The patient was started on
intramuscular cyanocobalamin.  Hematocrit was trended throughout
hospitalization.
.
#. Hypertension: patient's blood pressure was controlled while
off medication during admission.  His enalapril was held given
acute kidney injury, and his HCTZ, nadolol and amlodipine was
held due the patient's normotensive status.  Metoprolol was
started when the patient developed an episode of atrial
fibrillation while on the medical floor.
.
#. Abdominal aortic aneurysm:  the patient was scheduled to
undergo elective repair of AAA at an outside hospital while he
was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].  Blood pressures were checked often, with
a plan to obtain a stat echocardiogram if he became hypotensive.

.
#. Dyslipidemia: the patient was continued on his home statin
medication while he was admitted.
.
#. Glaucoma: the patient was continued on his glaucoma
medications during admission.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 year old with PMHx COPD who was found down
in hotel room.  Per report, he had been having several days of
N/V/D with possible AMS x1 day.  He was taken to [**Hospital3 **]
where he was found to be unconcious, hypotensive, altered,
mumbling, responding only to pain. He had right CVL placed,
started on levophed, and intubated.  He had a difficult
intubation requiring 30 of Etomidate and 10 of Vec and 2 passes
with a glide scope.  A 7.0mm tube was placed.  Labs returned
with Cr 9.7, K of 7.7 with peaked T waves and widened QRS.  He
was given CaCl x2, insulin/D50, 2 amps bicarb, and 3L NS.  He
was started on zosyn, but this was stopped when he reached [**Hospital1 18**]
as it was discovered he has an allergy to penicillin.  He was
initially difficult to ventilate at [**Hospital3 15402**] so was paralyzed
with 2 doses of vec and was given solumedrol/albuterol for
?obstructive process.  Transported via [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] during
which time he became easier to ventilate.  Labs showed K
remaining elevated at 6.8 - he got Cagluconate, amp of bicarb.
EKG improved, with slightly peaked T waves, QRS 78.  CT
Head/Neck was done and was ok.  CT A/P showed RLL consolidation,
confirmed on CT Chest.  ABG shoed increased CO2 so his RR  was
increased to 28.  He was given Levaquin/flagyl/vanco as well as
lasix 40mg IV with 3L urine output while in ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated on
pressors.

Imaging:
[**2102-4-20**] Portable CXR:
FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube terminates near the thoracic
inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube
passes beneath the left hemidiaphragm, its distal course not
imaged. Opacification in the right lower hemithorax suggests a
pleural effusion with volume loss including mild rightward shift
of mediastinal structures most suggestive of atelectasis. An
infectious causes is not excluded, however. The left lung
appears clear.  Although the extreme left costophrenic sulcus is
partly excluded, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on
the left side. Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal
and hilar contours are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in a somewhat high lying position,
approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. If clinically indicated,
the tube could be advanced by approximately 3 cm.
2. Right basilar opacification with volume loss including
suspicion for a
pleural effusion.
.
[**2102-4-20**] Head CT: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved throughout. The ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration. No fractures are
noted. Opacification within the paranasal sinuses is likely
related to recent intubation. Mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2102-4-20**] CT Chest: FINDINGS: The right middle and lower lobe are
collapsed. Bronchiectasis is mild in the segmental and
subsegmental bronchi of the middle lobe, and in the subsegmental
divisions of the superior and basal segments. There is no
central bronchial  occlusion. The constellation suggests that
atelectasis may well be chronic. There is no indication of
pneumonia or pleural or pericardial abnormality. A few small
bronchi in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe are
impacted and there is mild heterogeneity in background density
of both upper lobes suggesting small airway obstruction or mild
emphysema. Mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically
enlarged. In the absence of contrast administration, I cannot
say that there are no enlarged right hilar lymph nodes (there
are none on the left), but even if right hilar nodes are
present, they are not contributing to the atelectasis because
there is no bronchial obstruction.
Heart is normal size and the study is notable for the virtual
absence of atherosclerotic calcification, except for small
plaques at the bifurcation of the innominate artery. ET tube is
in standard placement. Excretions are pooled above the inflated
cuff.
This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis except
to note there is no adrenal mass. A small Bochdalek hernia in
the posterior right hemidiaphragm transmits only subphrenic fat.

IMPRESSION:
1. Combination of mild but diffuse bronchiectasis in collapsed
right middle and lower lobes. In the absence of bronchial
obstruction, this suggests that the collapse is not acute. No
evidence of pneumonia. Minimal mucoid impaction in small bronchi
in the upper lobe.
2. Either small airway obstruction or mild emphysema.
.
CT C-spine: FINDINGS: Imaged portions of the brain are better
visualized on the concurrent head CT. Patient is intubated.
Nasogastric and endotracheal tubes are in appropriate position.
No evidence of fractures or acute alignment abnormalities. No
evidence of critical spinal canal stenosis. Visualized portions
of the lung bases show some scarring in the right upper lobe.
Left upper lobe is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture.
.
CT Abdomen/pelvis: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: At the right lower lung
bases consolidative processes with air bronchograms and volume
loss including rightward shift. No pericardial effusion. No
pleural effusion. The left lung is clear.
Within the abdomen, the evaluation structures is limited without
IV contrast, however, with these limitations in mind, the liver
is unremarkable. The gallbladder has been surgically removed.
The spleen, bilateral kidneys and pancreas are all unremarkable.
There is some fat stranding of unclear significance around the
left adrenal. The adrenals themselves are unremarkable.
An NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach and ending at the
pylorus. The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable. Large
bowel is also unremarkable.
No mesenteric adenopathy is appreciated.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and prostate
are all unremarkable. The patient has a Foley catheter.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The osseous structures are unremarkable. No
concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Consolidative process in the right lower lobe consistent with
pneumonia versus atelectasis; sequelae of aspiration could also
be considered particularly noting historical circumstances.
.
[**2102-4-21**] Portable CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of a right internal jugular central line
with its tip in the mid superior vena cava. The endotracheal
tube has its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina,
unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
diaphragm with the tip not identified. Patchy and linear opacity
at the right base is stable suggestive of patchy and
subsegmental atelectasis. Probable small layering right
effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of
pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable given differences in
positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old male with a past medical history significant for
COPD, DM, HTN who presents after being found down with hypoxic
and hypercarbic respiratory failure, RLL consolidation,
hyperkalemia, and [**Last Name (un) **].

# Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure - Patient has a
history of COPD, on admission had prolonged expiration phase,
but no expiratory wheezing on exam.  CT showed large right lower
lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia, possibly
aspiration.  No evidence of fluid overload on exam.  Given body
habitus, may have component of hypoventilation or OSA.  Urgent
bronchoscopy in MICU showed secretions in RLL but no mass or
obstructing lesion - sample sent for culture/gram stain.  He was
treated for health-care acquired pneumonia with
vancomycin/meropenem/levofloxacin for atypical coverage pending
culture results.  Legionella antigen negative.  The patient
self-extubated on [**4-23**] and was able to be maintained with
non-invasive ventilation thereafter.

# Aspiration pneumonia- Patient was started on vancomycin,
meropenem and levofloxacin (for atypical coverage) in the MICU.
Upon transfer to the general medicine floor, the patient was
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics. As the patient
clinically improved, the patient was transitioned to oral
antibiotics, Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (for coverage of
anaerobic bacteria). The patient remained afebrile on oral
antibiotics. The patient was discharged home with another 3 days
of Levofloxacin and Clindamycin to complete a 10-day course for
treatment of aspiration pneumonia. Supplemental oxygen was
weaned and then discontinued. The patient was saturating in the
mid to high 90s at rest on room air and had ambulatory
saturation of 91-94% on room air day prior to discharge.

# Shock - Most likely from hypovolemia and sepsis.  Bedside
ultrasound showed collapse of IJ with hyperdynamic and fully
contracting ventricles consistent with hypovolemia.  While EKG
showed low voltages, he did not have evidence of pericardial
effusion or low EF on bedside U/S.  Per the OMR note, he was
recently on steroids for COPD so he is at risk for AI.  He was
treated for pneumonia, provided aggressive fluid resuscitation,
and provided stress dose steroids.  He was weaned off pressors
after 24 hours and his pressure normalized.

# Hyperkalemia - The patient exhibited persistent kyperkalemia
despite adequate treatment, and despite good renal function.
EKGs initially showed mild peaked T waves, but QRS remained
stable.  Normalized after the first 24 hours.

# Acute renal failure - Likely related to hypovolemia given the
patient's admission exam.  CK initially flat so the patient's
acute renal failure was not attributed to rhabdomyolysis. Serum
creatinine improved with hydration to 1.6, although there is no
clear baseline for this patient. Serum creatinine was trended
through the admission, and the patient's serum creatinine
normalized, ranging from 0.9 to 1.0.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Patient will need to have renal function
reassessed at his next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].

# Pancytopenia - Upon transfer from the ICU to the floor, the
patient's cell counts were noted to be falling. Thrombocytopenia
initially was most pronounced. The patient did receive heparin
during the admission; 4T score of 4, classifying the patient's
probability of HIT as intermediate. The patient's CBC was
trended daily, and his white count and hematocrit were noted to
be falling as well. The differential included marrow suppression
secondary to sepsis or secondary to medication. On day of
discharge, the patient's blood cell lines were noted to be
uptrending.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Patient will need to have follow-up CBC at
next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hypertension - Patient with a history of hypertension; as an
outpatient, patient is maintained on amlodipine 10, HCTZ 12.5mg,
and lisinopril 20mg daily. These medications were initially held
in light of shock. Patient's blood pressure initially ran in the
150s systolic. The patient was started on amlodipine 10mg daily
initially. With a stable trend in the patient's serum
creatinine, the patient's lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide
were restarted. With initiation of patient's full
anti-hypertensive regimen, the patient's systolic blood pressure
ranged in the 120s-130s systolic.

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - The patient had
albuterol and ipratropium inhalers available to him through his
admission. The patient was also given a nicotine patch through
the admission. Multiple times through the admission, the
importance of smoking cessation was emphasized to the patient.
He was also empirically started on Tiotropium inhaler once daily
on discharge. Upon discharge, the patient was provided with a
prescription for nicotine patches to aid with smoking cessation.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: PFTs as an outpatient if not already done.
Smoking cessation counseling with the patient's primary care
provider.

# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - As an outpatient, the patient is on
500mg metformin [**Hospital1 **]. Upon admission, the patient was
transitioned to an insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemic
coverage. On the medicine floor, the patient's finger stick
blood glucose ranged from 125-175, and he required minimal
insulin coverage. The patient was discharged home with
instructions to continue taking 500mg metformin [**Hospital1 **].

# History of muscle spasm - Patient was continued on home dose
of standing Valium 10mg TID.

# Chronic Low Back Pain - Oxycodone was restarted when the
patient was transferred to the medicine floor. Dosing was
up-titrated to original home dose and frequency on day of
discharge.

# History of substance abuse - Through the patient's stay in the
MICU, he was placed on a CIWA scale. The patient did not score
while in the ICU. On the medicine floor, the patient did not
score, and CIWA scale was discontinued. Of note, the patient has
been sober from alcohol for the past 17 years.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up pending HIV serology.

# Hepatitis C - Patient serology confirmed during this
admission. Viral load negative. Patient has not pursued
treatment in the past. Hepatitis B serology and HIV were also
drawn during this admission.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Discussion between the patient and his PCP
regarding treatment for hepatitis C. Patient will need hepatitis
B vaccination given hepatitis B serology. Follow-up pending HIV
serology.

# History of insomnia - Patient's home Seroquel was held upon
admission in light of patient's serious illness. This was
initially held on the medicine floors as the patient still
appeared drowsy. On day of discharge, patient was instructed to
continue Seroquel at home dosing.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
TCA Overdose, Depression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 22F with a history of polysubstance abuse and
depression who now presents after an ingestion of pills. The
history was gathered from her father and cousin. [**Name (NI) **] was in
her usual state of health at 7am on morning of admission and
when she reported to family that she had just ingested 14
Doxepin pills. She became nauseated and mentioned she needed to
vomit. She had a change in mental status, becoming confused and
the father carried her into the car and drove her to the
emergency department at [**Hospital6 **]. Initial
vitals were t99.1 111/67 130 14 100 RA. ECG was noted to be
without signs of TCA toxicity and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation. At [**Hospital1 18**], vitals initially p 110 bp
130/70 28 98 4L. She was noted to be somnolent and was intubated
for airway protection and to get head CT. Toxicology consultant
evaluated the patient in the ED and recommended serial ECGs and
monitoring in MICU.
.
In the MICU ([**2102-6-3**]), the patient was sedated with propofol
20-100 mcg/kg/min IV drip and was unresponsive. On the floor,
initial MICU vitals were 97.1, 121/84, 81, 100% (intubated).
Toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, methadone, and
tricyclics. EKGs were monitored Q1 hr; no abnormalities
including QT or QRS elongation were seen. No intracranial
process was seen on CT, and CXR was within normal limits. She
remained stable overnight. On morning of HD #2, patient was
extubated and EKGs remained WNL. Potassium (2.8) was repleted.
Psychiatry was consulted and diagnosed polysubstance abuse,
major depression (r/o PTSD), and believe that it is still unsafe
for her to be discharged.  They started patient on Valium 5 mg
PO tid/prn for anxiety and Seroquel 25-50mg po tid/prn for
agitation; in addition, they recommended a 1:1 sitter.  At this
time, she was transferred to SIRS service.  On the floor, she
denied any chest pains, shortness of breath, palpatations,
suicidal or homicidal ideations, and reports that she did not
intend to kill herself, but was trying to use them for sleep.

Past Medical History:
-Asthma as a child, and has a home nebulizer which she never
uses. She does not use inhalers
-Polysubtance abuse.

Social History:
Polysubtance abuse including heroin, cocaine. +tobacco use 1 PPD
x 5 years, per father no history of significant etoh use.


Family History:
No significant family history. Father is healthy.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Evaluation is slightly limited by patient motion
artifact. There
is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect or
infarction.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is no
fracture. Inspissated secretions in the posterior nasopharynx
likely reflect
the patient's intubated status.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: An ET tube tip terminates 4.4 cm above the
carina. An NG
tube and sidehole projects below the diaphragm in the left upper
quadrant.
Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is
no focal
airspace opacification. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No
gross osseous
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. ETT and NGT in
appropriate
position.



Brief Hospital Course:
# TCA overdose: Patient presents with intoxication of doxepin;
toxicology screen was positive for methadone, TCAs, and cocaine.
Patient states that last methadone dose was x2 weeks ago and she
took suboxone x2 days prior to admission.  Patient was initially
admitted to the medical ICU where she was intubated to secure
the airway, serial EKGs were done (all showed NSR without
abnormalities), and patient was monitored.  On HD #2, patient
was extubated, and was monitored for symptoms of hypotension,
palpatations, chest pain, or any other symptoms of TCA
intoxication. EKGs remained normal throughout MICU course
without arrythmias. She was then transferred to the medicine
services after patient's peak for toxic symptoms were over
(active metabolites 12-24 hours), EKGs remained normal
throughout the course, and she exhibited no symptoms upon
discharge.
.
# Psychiatric Status: Patient was seen by psychiatric in the
MICU for questionable suicidal ideation. The patient denied any
suicidal or homicidal ideation, and repeatedly wanted to go
home.  Psychiatry reported that she has polysubstance abuse,
depression, and borderline personality.  She was given Valium,
Seroquel, and Ibuprofen PRN for anxiety, agitation, and possible
opiate withdrawal.  She had 1:1 sitter throughout her hospital
stay. Upon discharge, she was counseled on depression and an
appointment was made for outpatient psychiatric care near her
home.
.
#Anemia: Patient presented with hematocrit of 31.5 (baseline
unknown), with microcytic features and wide RDW. Iron levels are
low (20) with low TIBC (257), and her low MCV (68) do not
suggest a complete iron deficiency picture. Iron deficiency
alone is unlikely to cause such a microcytosis picture,
therefore her anemia could be secondary to a mixed etiology of
minor thalassemia (microcytosis of 68) and iron deficiency.  She
was started on iron supplementation and outpatient care for
follow-up for her anemia.
.
#Elevated WBC and fever: The patient had elevated WBC (20) and
low-grade fever 100.4 in the MICU, but trended down while
admitted to the medicine floor (WBC 12, temp 98.2).  She has no
indication of infection as she clinically has no syptoms of
fevers/chills and does not feel overall unwell; in addition, CXR
shows no abnormalities.  The most likely etiology was s/p MICU
extubation and stress response.

Medications on Admission:
None.

Discharge Medications:
1. Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg (65 mg Iron) Capsule, Sustained
Release Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sustained Release PO once a day.


Discharge Disposition:

82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma who is being transferred for concern of
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  Per the pt's niece, he was in his
usual state of health until [**7-24**], when he fell while unloading a
piece of furniture from his car.  Per OSH notes, he did not lose
conciousness nor complain of any cardiac prodrome - he felt this
was a mechanical fall.  He was too weak to get up on his own and
was on the ground for ~2 hours prior to being found by his
neighbor.  [**Name (NI) **] was taken to [**Hospital3 **] and admitted to a
telemetry unit.  He was noted to have elevated CK, which peaked
at 3320, then trended down with IVF.  Cardiology was consulted
but felt this was a mechanical fall and had planned to obtain an
echocardiogram.  On [**7-25**], the patient was noted to have
increased weakness and progressed to a feeling of an inability
to move his extremities on [**7-26**].  Shortly after this, he became
bradycardic and hypotensive and went into respiratory failure.
He was intubated, had CPR performed, then was transferred to the
CCU.  He was intermittently on pressors and was felt to have
developed an aspiration pneumonia.  He was initially on
clindamycin, then broadened to vancomycin and cefepime.  His O2
requirement improved and there were plans to extubate him on
[**7-28**], however a NIF was noted to be -10 and the patient was noted
to have complete paralysis of bilateral extremities.  CT was
negative, neuro consulted and felt he may have an ascending
paralysis such as GBS and recommended transfer to a tertiary
care facility.
.
In the ICU, the patient is intubated.  He is able to shake his
head yes and no to questions.

Imaging:
CXR ([**7-28**]):
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**8-24**]: FINDINGS: There is exaggerated lordosis of the
cervical spine. There is
minimal retrolisthesis of C4 over C5 vertebra by 4 mm. The
vertebral bodies
are normal in height and marrow signal intensity. There is no
evidence of
acute fracture.
Prevertebral soft tissue is noted from C1 to C5 level.

Hyperintensity is noted in posterior paraspinal muscles and soft
tissues from
C1 to C6 levels. A small hypointense area is noted in right
paraspinal
muscles at the C7-T1 level measuring 1.8 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm in
craniocaudad, AP,
and transverse dimensions. This likely represents calcification.


There is multilevel disc degenerative disease. There is
desiccation of all
cervical intervertebral discs.

At C2-C3 level, there is no significant spinal canal or neural
foraminal
narrowing.

At C3-C4 level, there is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion
causing
indentation and compression of spinal cord. There is severe
spinal canal
stenosis. The disc with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes
causes moderate
bilateral foraminal stenosis.

At C4-C5, there is posterior disc protrusion causing indentation
and
compression of the spinal cord and severe spinal canal
narrowing. The disc
with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes causes moderate right
and mild left
foraminal narrowing.

At C5-C6, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge causing
indentation of the
anterior subarachnoid space. There is no evidence of significant
spinal canal
or neural foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7 level, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge without
significant
spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

Hyperintense signal is noted in cervical spinal cord from C2 to
C7 level.
This likely represents combination of compressive edema and
contusion
secondary to fall.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma with neurologic signs concerning for
cervical spine injury vs GBS vs myositis.
.
# Weakness/paralysis - Concerning for cervical spine injury (may
have occurred during intubation) vs ascending paralysis such as
GBS vs myositis/myopathy given elevated CK on admission.
Patient has no clear history of prodromal illness for GBS, but
this is not necessary for the diagnosis.  CK trending down
without any intervention for myositis making it less likely.  MR
[**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] performed early [**7-29**] showed chronic DJD of C-spine with
significant narrowing of spinal canal, compression of spinal
cord, and associated edema from C3-T1.  Spine surgery was
consulted and felt that the paralaysis is secondary to spinal
cord compression with poor prognosis if patient taken to the OR
and very low probability of recovery of any function.  Spine
surgery had a discussion with family who chose to pursue
surgical repair.

.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure - [**1-27**] diaphragmatic weakness and
pneumonia/mucus plugging.  CXR on presentation showed complete
whiteout of left lung - bronchoscopy the evening of [**7-28**] showed
copious amounts of mucus plugging that was suctioned out.  Post
bronch, has been able to be weaned to 60% FiO2.  A repeat CXR on
[**7-29**] showed substantial improvement, with possible consolidation
in the LLL.  Due to neuromuscular dysfunction, he was continued
on ventilation.
.
# HCAP - Signs of LLL PNA seen on bronchoscopy with edematous,
red airways.  Was thought to have aspirated at OSH and covered
with vanco/cefepime.  Has been in hospital > 48 hours so needs
to be covered for HCAP.  Plan to continue coverage and request
sputum culture results from OSH.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets of 114 on [**7-28**], down from 147 on
admission to OSH.  No signs of spontaneous bleeding at this
time.  Differential includes med effect vs decreased production.
.
# Anemia - Mild normocytic anemia.  On admission Hgb was 14.7.
[**Month (only) 116**] be [**1-27**] dilution vs decreased production vs bleed (although
no evidence).  Plan to follow CBC.
.
# Elevated AST/ALT - mildly elevated, other LFTs are normal
including bili.  [**Month (only) 116**] be related to periods of hypotension.  Plan
to trend LFTs.
.
# Bradycardia - Bradycardic at OSH, has been stable here.  [**Month (only) 116**]
be secondary to [**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **] or other neuro problem affecting
autonomic nervous system.  Presumably, was ruled out for MI
after this happened but unknown if this did happen.  EKG shows
no evidence of infarct.  Echo planned for [**7-29**], may be deferred
given emergent surgical intervention.
.
# Elevated CK - Likely secondary to rhabdo from fall, CK's have
been trending down without acute intervention and renal function
is stable.
.
# FEN: IVF as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
# Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and subQ heparin
# Access: peripherals
# Communication: Patient
# Disposition: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] trauma ICU
for possible surgical intervention per Spine surgery

In the evening of [**2162-7-30**], after discussion with patient and
family members, the patient's code status was changed to Comfort
Measures Only. His pain was controlled with IV morphine. At
1030pm, the patient was noted to have no respiratory drive, no
pulse and no heart/lung sounds. The on call resident was called
to evaluate the patient, and the patient was pronounced dead at
1040pm on [**2162-7-30**].

History of Present Illness:
.
PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 45938**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 45939**], [**Hospital **] Hospital ED
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77108**].
.
HPI:  74yoF with PMH of tobacco use and glaucoma (no regular
medical care with last PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 6 years ago) who developed
fever and body aches [**2136-2-1**] and progressively worsening
confusion since then presented to her PCP's office today with
complaints of generalized malaise and feeling unwell.  She
specifically complained of inability to sleep and requested
sleep medication however also endorsed generalized weakness and
perhaps some dizziness.  Her PCP referred her to [**Hospital **]
Hospital ED given her symptoms and she reportedly looked
""overall unwell"".  She (and family) report that her symptoms
began on [**2136-2-1**] at which time she developed ""body aches"" and
subjective fevers/chills.  She also had a very mild dry cough.
Her daughter reports progressive confusion mainly over the past
few days.  She has also had poor PO intake (food and fluid) [**3-10**]
poor appetite.  She denies sore throat, runny nose,
N/V/diarrhea/abdominal pain, dysuria/hematuria.  She further
denies night sweats, signifiant weight loss.  She also denies
HA, changes in vision, neck stiffness.
.
At the OSH ED, noted peripheral blood WBC >60K with a reported
""left shift"".  RUL infiltrate was noted on CXR and she received
1 dose levofloxacin IV.  ABG initially showed pCO2=59 however
she became increasingly lethargic and repeat ABG showed pCO2=78.
 She was simultaneously noted to be hypoxemic (paO2 not clear),
but SaO2 70% on NRB prior to intubation.  She was intubated and
was noted to be hypotensive with nadir 65/40 (? post sedation
vs. before) and was started on dopamine via peripheral IV
initially at 20mcg/kg/min.  Dopamine was decreased to
5mcg/kg/min prior to transfer with maintenance of SBPs 90s.  She
became tachycardic to the 140s on dopamine so was changed to
levophed without tachycardia and maintenance of MAPS
approximately 50-60.

RELEVANT IMAGING
Echo [**3-2**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No definite aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-2-10**], the
findings are similar.
.
[**3-1**] CT sinuses
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement of the mucosal thickening in the paranasal
sinuses as described above. Resolution of the fluid within the
middle ear cavities bilaterally.

2. Persistent partial opacification of mastoid air cells
bilaterally.
.
[**2-29**]
chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1) Persisting multifocal consolidation, not significantly
changed.
2) Interval development of underlying pulmonary edema with
increasing, now moderate, bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes likely reactive to the
underlying infectious process and/or CHF.
4) Lobulated, hypodense hepatic dome lesion, likely a cyst.
5) Left adrenal mass with Hounsfield Units between 5 and 15,
most likely an adenoma.
.
[**2-17**]-CT orbit, sella, IAC
IMPRESSION:

1. Paranasal sinus opacification as described above.
2. Soft/fluid density within the bilateral mastoid air cells and
right middle ear cavity without bony erosions or other
destructive changes. Findings may represent effusions of the
mastoid air cells and right middle ear cavity, versus
otomastoiditis.
3. 7-mm well-circumscribed lytic area within the left occipital
lobe, likely an arachnoid granulation. If there is clinical
concern or previous history of malignancy, a bone scan could be
considered for further characterization.
.
[**2136-2-11**]
CT Torso
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidations that are most
consistent with pneumonia.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Suboptimal position of the right internal jugular central
line with its tip in the inferior vena cava.

4. Ascites.

5. Cholelithiasis.

6. Left adrenal mass, which cannot be further characterized on
this study. Further evaluation with MRI may be obtained when
clinically feasible
.
echo [**2136-2-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.  74F h/o tobacco use,
glaucoma (no past regular medical care) developed fever and body
aches [**2136-2-1**], with progressively worsening confusion since
then, presented to OSH ED and was found to have WBC 60+, RUL and
hypotension requiring pressors, intubated and was transferred
for further management of septic shock [**3-10**] pneumococcal RUL PNA.
 Now with resolved WBC but continued respiratory failure and
ventilator dependancy; Now s/p Trach/PEG.  Also now with new
growth of mold out of [**2-26**] sputum culture, and staph coag (-)
off the CVL tip on [**2-28**], completed treatment for pneumococcal
pneumonia, as well as herpes lung infection, still being treated
for mold in sputum-aspergillus infection.
.
Problems:
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
She presented with a hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure
with an acute on chronic respiratory acidosis secondary to
pneumonia which developed into ARDS.  A chest CT showed
multifocal pneumonia, sputum culture showed penicillin resistant
 strep pneumonia.  Empirical Vancomycin and Flagyl were
discontinued, and levofloxacin and zosyn were continued for a
completed course.

There was also a component of underlying COPD exacerbation for
which she was on albuterol and atrovent.  Diuresis was initiated
for a component of volume overload that was felt to be present.
However she was allowed to self diurese after she became
euvolemic.  She was also found to have a herpetic pulmonary
infection (tracheobronchitis).  BAL washings ([**2-14**])confirmed
HSV-positive herpetic lesions in trachea.  Acyclovir was started
[**2-21**], ending [**3-6**] (2 week course); liver (AST 13. ALT 17), renal
function were monitored.

She had previously had aspergillus in her sputum but negative
beta-glucan and galactomannan.  Whether this was a pathogen or a
contaminant was not clear.  She was started voriconazole [**2-29**],
CT sinus and CT chest did not show invasive disease. She should
continue on this for two weeks and have LFTs monitored weekly.
She should also have a follow up sputum  for KOH and fungal
culture in [**3-12**] weeks after stopping voriconazole.
.
Vent settings at d/c
ventilator settings:
CPAP 46% FiO2
PEEP 5
Pt averaging tidal volumes of 20
respiratory rate 30
.
She was in chronic respiratory failure and did not tolerate
weaning of vent given need for high PEEP & FIO2.  Thus, she had
a tracheostomy placed and is now being slowly weaning from vent.
 Trach: Dead space:tidal volume 78%.  She needs PRN decreases in
 FiO2, PEEP.
.
HYPOTENSION: On admission she had leukocytosis WBC 60, fever,
tachycardia c/w SIRS and since she had pneumonia and hypotension
she was in spetic shock.  She was requiring Norepinephrine.  In
the presence of a murmur on exam subacute bacterial endocarditis
was felt to be a possible etiology, thus an echo was done that
was negative for vegetations, Normal LVEF >55%, +1MR.  Her
random cortisol was 59, with an appropriate decrease with
cortisol challenge.  As there were no ischemic changes in
continguous leads cardiogenic etiology was not felt to be
likely.  On [**2-12**] she was weaned successfully off pressor support.
  She occasionally required small boluses for occasional
decreases in blood pressure and to aid urine output.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  She had no known CRI by history (although
no consistent medical care for several years).  BUN/creatinine
ratio suggestive of prerenal etiology, improved to nml range
after IVFs. Admission BUN=63, Cr=1.3, Discharge BUN=23, Cr=0.5.
.

ILEUS: She had increasing abdominal distention with no BM.  KUB
done on [**2-10**] c/w ileus.  Abd CT demonstrated ascites but no SBO.
She was on a bowel regimen and TF with appropriate holding for
residuals were done.  This resolved [**2-13**].
.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  She had ARDS, infection, but also heavy
sedation while intubated.  On [**3-4**], decreased scheduled diazepam
with goal for autotaper, and decreased fentanyl patch to 12.5mg.
On [**3-5**] the patient was found to be awakening, able to
communicate somewhat with family and staff. Diazepam was
discontinued [**3-6**] and ativan 1mg Q6h:PRN was started.
.
ANEMIA: She had a slowly decreasing Hct.  She was guiaic
negative and did not have any gross bleeding.  Likely secondary
to blood draws, hemolysis labs were negative, should continue to
monitor. Admit HCT was 32. Discharge HCT was 26, this was stable
for 3 days prior to discharge. During admission patient was
transfused 1 unit of packed RBCs w/o complications.
.
RIGHT OTITIS MEDIA: ENT irrigated ear, no evidence of otitis
externa, likely otitis media s/p perforation or drained fluid
collection behind cerumen collection.  Recieved
ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone drops 5 drops TID in ear for 10
days.
Started first full day [**2-18**], ended [**2-28**].  Now resolved.
.
NUTRITION: PEG was placed at the time of tracheostopy.  Tube
feed recs. tube feeds-Nutren Pulmonary Full strength;
Additives:Beneprotein, 10 gm/day
Starting rate: 40 ml/hr; Do not advance rate Goal rate: 40 ml/hr
Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 100 ml
Other instructions: Please add 150 ml H20 TID to TF
.
GLAUCOMA: She remained on her home medications of timolol and
travatan
.
ACCESS: PICC line placed [**2-27**]: NO signs of infection at picc
site.

.
Follow up:
Pt will continue voriconazole until [**3-14**] for a total of 2weeks of
therapy
-Pt needs LFTs drawn on [**3-12**].
-sputum culture needed [**2136-3-28**] (for fungal culture and KOH)
-galactomannan and B-glucan [**2136-3-12**]
-Please contact your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 45938**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77110**] for a

History of Present Illness:
77F with NSCLC (LUL involvement, lymphangitis spread, pleural
involvement, recurrent L pleural effusion though not pleurodesis
candidate, brain mets) s/p cycle #2 paclitaxal/[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**11-24**]),
presenting with dyspnea (RR=35) and hypoxia (81%RA). Pleural
effusion last drained about 1.5wks PTA. Admision CXR showeed L
white out and mediastinal/tracheal shift. ED unable to localize
fluid with US for tap. Pt needed CT scan, but unable to lie
flat, so she was intubated. Post intubation pt had immediate
blood pressure drop responsive to fluids (2 liters), then
continuing to have intermittent hypotension requiring bolusing
despite minimum sedation and required norepinephrine x2days
intermittently. Pt had equivocal cortasyn stimtest to 18.1 but
started on stress dose steroid along with fludricorsone for low
Na. Pt also transfused 4U PRBCs for hct of 25 with inapropriate
rise to 30 although blood loss was thought to be lost in
serosanguinous CT drainage and Hct stable for last 24h. On
admission to MICU pt started on Cefepime, Vancomycin and
Gentamycin due to fever and ANC of 340 and suspected sepsis,
which was weaned to only vancomycin on [**12-8**] due to positive Bld
Cx for coag neg staph [**1-31**] on [**12-5**]. Pt given GCSF with good
effect and ANC up to 1800 yesterday. Admission CT also showed
small subsegmental RLL PE but anticoagulation held due to brain
mets. CT also showed enormous Left sided effusion with two fluid
levels suggestive of hemothorax, mass effect w/ shift of
mediastinum to Right. In face of tenuous BP + possible
hemothorax, CT [**Doctor First Name **] placed Left Chest Tube for volume drainage
(2100cc removed). Due to continued large amount of drainage she
was planned for pleuradesis with doxycyline which was performed
[**2168-12-9**] with plan for repeat tomorrow.

[**12-18**] CXR There is an increasing hydropneumothorax in the left
hemithorax since [**2168-12-14**]. The right lung is clear. The right IJ
line has been removed.

[**12-13**]  Chest CT 1) Interval placement of left-sided chest tube
with decrease in large left- sided pleural effusion with shift
of the mediastinum back to the left. Small pneumothorax with
loculated hydropneumothorax.
2) Partial re-expansion of the left lung with patchy opacities.
These likely represent areas of atelectasis.
3) Scattered nodules within the right lobe and spiculated mass
within the left upper lobe appears stable in short interval.
4) Right renal mass, left adrenal mass and osseous lesions again
identified

Brief Hospital Course:
Pleural Effusion-Pt with known longstanding left sided malignant
effusion. CT placed in the ED as per HPI and pt intubated due to
inability to lay flat for CT to evaluate effusion but was
quickly weaned. Pt had doxycyline Pleurodesis on [**12-9**] and 14
and CTube removed [**12-13**] due to pt discomfort and continued low
grade fevers. She continued to have dullness at her left base
with complete whiteout of L hemithorax except for area of
pneumothorax on follow-up CXR, so IP saw pt and placed pleuridex
[**12-18**] and drained 500cc serous fluid with plan for weekly
pleurocentesis in pulmonary clinic. She was breathing
comfortably and had O2Sats of 94% on room air upon discharge.

Pancytopenia-Due to recent chemotherapy with
paclitaxol/carboplatin although counts responded briskly to GCSF
except for platelets.  She was initially treated as neutropenia
and sepsis due to hypotension and fever with Vancomycin,
gentamycin, cefepime which were discontinued on transfer to the
floor since no culture data was positive. Pt has history of
thrombocytopenia, and platelet count was slowly declining. We
started procrit and followed CBC daily. HitAb neg but held on
heparin for HIT I. DIC panel negative. There were no known
offending meds but did change ranitidine for protonix since it
was only suspected med.

Hypotension-Pt had acute episode of hypotension with intial
intubation which responded well to aggressive fluid boluses. Pt
had corasyn stim test to rule out adrenal insuffuciency which
was equivocal at 18, so she was started on stress dose steroids.
She was also placed on fludricorisone due to an elevated
potassium and low sodium. Pt remained normotensive upon transfer
to the floor on [**12-10**] and weaned off of steroids since there was
no suspected reason for acute adrenal insufficiency.  BP and
lytes remained stable for the remaineder of her hospitalization
except for mild hypernatremia that responded well to
encouragement of free water intake.

SVT-Pt with new afib per attg. Pt with LAA in previous ECG most
likely due to longstanding HTN. Acute hypotension and stressed
state may have contributed. No anticoagulation since it was
thought to be transient.

PE-Pt with known subsegmental PE on admission CT. Pt with
appropriate sats on room air. SC heparin stopped for HIT
possiblity and didn't anticoagulate initially due to brain mets
although attending considering anticoagulation. No role for
repeat CTPA since she has known PE.

Oral thrush-Due to steroid use. Improving on clotrimazole
lozenges now that steriods stopped.

NSCLC-Pt receiving chemo prior to admission and effusion is not
reason to stop treatment. Will restart chemo if Plat ct >100 per
attg likely Iressa. Chest CT shows no interval change in size of
pulmonary nodules post chemo.

DM-Pt had poorly controlled blood sugars while on steroids, but
were controlled to <150 when steroids weaned. She was initially
on RISS but this was discontinued with steroid taper.

Pain-Patient had pain at CTube site initially which was well
controlled with oxycontin 10mg q12hours. Percocet prn was added
with increasing pain after placement of tunneled pleuridex but
plan is to wean as tolerated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] was transferred from OSH after cardiac cath revealed
left main and multi-vessel disease. As well as echo showing 3+
mitral regurgitation. Upon admission he was appropriately
medically managed and worked-up for surgery. On [**10-10**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 4 and mitral valve repair. Please see
operative report for surgical detail. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive management in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one his
chest tubes were removed. All drips were weaned off on post-op
day one and on post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Beta blockers and diuretics
were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On post-op day three his epicardial pacing wires were
removed. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. He was transfused a total of 2 units
PRBCs postoperatively for anemia. He continued to progress and
on POD#5 was discharged to home with VNA. He was instructed on
all necessary follow up appointments.

History of Present Illness:
25M directly transferred from OSH after being found down for
unknown duration (hours) while intoxicated now w/ LE compartment
syndrome w/ rhabdomyolysis and oliguria.  At OSH, found to have
potassium of 6.9, creatinine 3.8, CK >20,000.

Ortho was consulted at OSH and compartment pressures were
measured ~50 (L lateral?) w/ diastolic 78 and possibly also
involving the R gluteal region. Pt received kayexelate 90mg and
3
doses of 10mg insulin w/ amps of D50 for hyperkalemia and was
reportedly given 8L crystalloid (NS).  He is transferred here
for
possible fasciotomy and further management.  He c/o R gluteal
and
entire L thigh pain with weakness in R foot and L hip.  He
denies
any other associated symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2200-11-16**] after being found unconscious
in his home for an unknown duration of time (likely >12hrs). The
patient was brought to an OSH and found to have a potassium of
6.9, creatinine 3.8, CK >20,000. The orthopedic service  was
consulted at OSH and compartment pressures were measured and
found to be elevated. Pt received Kayexalate 90mg and 3 doses of
10mg insulin w/ amps of D50 for hyperkalemia and was reportedly
given 8L crystalloid (NS). He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further workup and management.

ICU course:

On admission to the trauma ICU, a left sided IJ dialysis
catheter was placed for temporary dialysis access. He was taken
to the operating room by orthopedics for bilateral decompressive
fasciotomies of b/l gluteal and thigh compartments. VAC
dressings were placed. Postoperatively he received 4 U of PRBC
for dropping HCT in setting of copious VAC output, hypotension,
tachycardia with good results. He was dialyzed on HD1.
On HD2 he was taken back to OR for washout, debridement and VAC
change. He was successfully extubated later that day. Per
nephrology recommendations the patient did not undergo
hemodialysis on HD2. He remained oliguric. The patient was
transfused and additional unit of PRBC for falling HCT during
the day (22 from 28 preop). He was started on a Dilaudid PCA for
pain control. He received 2 U of PRBC overnight since the
response to the first unit had not been adequate. His HCT was
again 22.4 and 2 additional U of PRBC were given on HD3.
On HD4 he was taken back to the operating room by Ortho for
washout and closure of the RLE wound and VAC re-placement in the
[**Hospital1 **]. Postoperatively he remained intubated for acute
desaturation and was hypoxemia. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions, greater on the right. A bronchoscopy was also
performed.
On HD5 the patient was able to be extubated and CXR showed
slight improvement in b/l pleural effusions. The patient
received HD. His HCT remained stable at 23.2. The patient was
deemed ready for transfer to the regular surgical floor.

Floor course:

Upon transfer out of the ICU he continued to progress slowly.
His acute kidney injury continued to warrant close monitoring
and hemodialysis treatments 3-4x/week. His BUN/Cr were followed
closely remaining quite elevated until [**12-4**] when it was down to
5.6 after peaking at 10.3 on [**11-24**]. His temporary dialysis line
was removed due to fever and elevated white blood. Once his
fevers defervesced a right tunneled catheter for dialysis was
placed without any complications. He has received several
treatments since that time with most recent on [**2200-12-3**] where his
pre-dialysis creatinine was 8.8 and as noted previously on [**12-4**]
was 5.6 and he is making urine (total of 300 cc's for 24 hours
on [**12-3**]). His electrolytes in general were abnormal due to his
[**Last Name (un) **] and have begun to show signs of return to normal. It is
expected that he will only require hemodialysis for another 1
possibly 2 weeks if he continues to show signs of improving
kidney function.

It should also be noted that he has received several rounds of
blood transfusions for falling HCT with lowest value of 17.9 on
[**2200-11-25**]. His HCT's since that time have ranged between 23-24.
For a very short period he was given weekly Epogen but this was
stopped per recommendations of Renal on [**2200-12-3**].

On [**2200-11-27**] he was taken back to the operating room by
orthoepdics for irrigation and debridement down to and inclusive
of muscle of 40 x 10 cm wound for a total of 400 sq cm, and
staged primary closure. There were no complications.

His staples were removed by Orthopedics on [**12-3**] and he will
follow up in [**2-27**] weeks in their outpatient clinic. In the
meantime he is receiving DVT prophylaxis with Heparin SQ,
orthopedics is asking that once he is discharged from rehab that
he be started on Aspirin 325 mg daily for a total 2 weeks.

He is also being treated for a wound cellulitis per
recomendations by ortho - total 7 day course. It is important
that on his HD days that he receives this medication after
dialysis treatment.

He was followed by Physical and Occupational therapy and has
been recommended for acute rhab after his hospital stay.

Past Medical History:
1. Small cell lung cancer, metastatic to liver and brain.
Followed by [**Year (4 digits) **] [**Year (4 digits) 40356**] with [**Hospital1 18**]. Last chemo was [**2147-9-19**]
and last radiation was [**2147-6-18**].
2. Dermatomyositis (paraneoplastic syndrome),
3. Hx of bronchitis
4. Hx L ankle fracture; other bone fractures
5. BPH
6. Pulmonary embolism [**10/2145**], cancer and IVIG related.
7. right 5th toe fracture ~[**2146-6-20**].

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2144-7-18**]: Presented with rash over forearms and torso.
[**2144-8-18**]: Later developed muscle weakness. Saw dermatologist, Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 16077**] - biopsy positive for dermatomyositis. Started on
prednisone 60 mg daily with good improvement of his rash and
weakness. He was also referred to a rheumatologist and
neurologist for further evaluation. Dysphagia symptoms also
apparent, evaluated by a speech and swallow therapist at [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2144-10-18**]: Radiographical workup - CT scanning showed a prominent
right hilar node and a lesion in the liver. Liver lesion by MRI
on [**2144-11-9**] at [**Hospital6 1109**] was equivocal.
[**2144-11-23**]: PETCT scan performed at [**Hospital1 **] showed abnormal
uptake in the right paratracheal lymph node, right hilum, liver
nodule in the mid portion of the right lobe, also a region of
the gallbladder.
[**2144-11-17**]: [**2144-11-26**]- an ultrasound guided liver biopsy was
performed at [**Hospital1 **]; lesion consistent with small cell lung
cancer. Staining shows positivity for synaptophysin, TTF-1, with
weak positivity for CK 7 and chromogranin (Pathologist Dr
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 83828**]). Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology ordered anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]
and anti-striate muscle antibody which are positive, done on
[**2144-12-7**]. (Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] positive by immunofluorescence, but was not
positive by Western blot). A head MRI was performed on [**12-16**]
and showed no evidence of intracranial malignancy.
[**2144-12-18**]: Started chemotherapy
[**2145-3-18**]: Complete chemotherapy
[**2145-6-17**]: Dermatomyositis flare; subsequently given course of
steroids, IVIG, methotrexate. Interval CT scans do not show
obvious evidence of cancer progression.
[**2145-10-18**]: Pulmonary Embolism [**2145-11-7**], started on Lovenox
[**2145-11-17**]: hematochezia thought to be inflammatory colitis,
resolved with rectal steroids
[**2145-12-18**]: Dermatomyositis (DM) flare with fevers and ulcerative
lesions; CT on [**2146-1-7**] shows no progression of cancer
[**2146-2-15**]: Fevers, DM continue; lovenox implicated as one of
causes of fevers; fondiparinux substituted for lovenox. Hi dose
IV steroids used to control DM sx.
[**2146-3-18**]: Fevers abated with use of fondiparinux. PETCT suggests
inflammatory changes rather than overt SCLC recurrence.
[**2146-5-18**]: Recurrent disease seen mainly in liver on PETCT
[**2146-6-6**].

TREATMENT HISTORY:
FIRST LINE REGIMEN: carboplatin (5 AUC on day 1) and

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with stage IV small cell
lung cancer s/p carboplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan C4 with
metastases to brain and liver, now presenting with complaint of
profuse diarrhea, shortness of breath, and fluid-responsive
hypotension in the setting of a newly diagnosed large pulmonary
embolism and [**Last Name (un) **].

#  PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  In setting of active malignancy.
Patient was initially started on a heparin gtt then subsequently
transitioned to fondaparinux and coumadin (allergy to lovenox).
Discharged when INR was 2.1 (given fondaparinux on day of
discharge so technically bridged for 24 hours).  Patient was
written for coumadin 5mg QD but switched to 4mg QD on discharge
given steep rise of INR.  Did not have oxygen requirement on
discharge.  Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] should likely remain on coumadin
indefinitely.  He will follow-up with PCP for INR check (this
was confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 391**] [**Name (STitle) **] on day of discharge).
Patient will have blood drawn for INR checks by VNA).

# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY WITH HYPOTENSION:  Prerenal etiology.
Creatnine normalized with fluids.

# DIARRHEA: Likely irinotecan related.  Resolved.  Stool studies
negative.

# CONSTIPATION:  Although initially admitted with diarrhea,
patient subsequently developed consipation.  He moved his bowels
on day of discharge after receiving an aggressive bowel regimen.
 He will be discharged on stool softeners and laxatives to use
as needed.

# PAIN MANAGEMENT:  Patient denied pain during this admission,
and said that he was not taking oxycontin at home.  This
medication was stopped on discharge (as it wasn't needed), but
can be resumed at patient's and PCP's discretion.  He can
continue percocet as needed.

# SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: Metastatic disease to brain and liver,
now s/p C4 irinotecan and s/p carboplatin and etoposide. Last
chemotherapy dosing on [**2147-9-19**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] will have close
follow-up with his outpatient heme/onc providers.

# DERMATOMYOSITIS (paraneoplastic syndrome):  Long-standing,
complicated issues that even pre-dates his cancer diagnosis.  No
acute issues during this hospitalization.  Patient was continued
on cellcept at 1500 [**Hospital1 **].

# ANEMIA:  Likely secondary to chemotherapy.  Patient's hct
trended down during admission and he was given 1 unit of blood
on [**2147-10-5**] to increase his reserve. He has no evidence of
bleeding and likely his hct was concentrated at time of
admission.

# CODE: FULL, confirmed, would not want prolonged care
# DISPOSITION:  Home with VNA.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to
[**Hospital1 18**].  You came in for progressive shortness of breath and
diarrhea and were ultimately found to have a new lung blood
clot. You were started on blood thinners (initially a heparin
drip and then a daily shot of fondaparinux), and you will be
discharged on a medication called warfarin.  You will need to
have your INRs (measure of how thin your blood is) checked on a
regular basis.  This will be done at your hematology/oncology
appointment on [**10-10**] as well as by your primary care doctor.

Your diarrhea was likely due to the chemotherapy irinotecan, and
this issue resolved.  You subsequently had constipation but you

Reason: Please eval extent and location of loculation and PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
35 year old man with Downs syndrome and lg PNA with loculations
on CXR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval extent and location of loculation and PNA
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT chest without contrast and reconstructions.

INDICATION: 35-year-old male with Down syndrome and pleural
loculations on chest x- ray. Initial presentation is right upper
quadrant pain and fever.

COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from the same date.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen without intravenous contrast
administration. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

Intravenous contrast was not administered secondary to elevated
creatinine.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The thyroid gland is grossly
unremarkable. The major airways are patent down to the
subsegmental level. The unopacified heart and great vasculature
are grossly unremarkable without pericardial effusion given
limitation of no IV contrast administration. There are scattered
prominent lymph nodes within the mediastinum, the largest of
which measures 1.5cm in short axis in a subcarinal location. No
axillary adenopathy is present. Limited views of the upper
abdomen without contrast demonstrate no abnormalities within the
liver, stomach, adrenal glands or spleen so far as visualized.

The left lung is clear. There is a small left pleural effusion.
Multiple loculated right-sided pleural fluid collections are
noted. The largest of these is along the right upper lobe
measuring approximately 12.2 x 4.4 cm in greatest dimension. Two
other prominent loculations lie in the right lung base, the
larger of which measures 7.4 x 7.2 cm. The attenuation of these
pleural collections is consistent with simple fluid. Compressive
atelectasis is noted in the right lung with septal thickening at
the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
detected.

IMPRESSION:

1. Loculated right pleural fluid collections. Given the absence
of contrast evaluation for enhancement and nodularity along the
pleura is limited.
2. Septal thickening and atelectasis in the right lung.
3. Borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy, may be reactive.
4. Small left pleural effusion.

***** [**2172-1-12**] RUQ ULTRASOUND:
Reason: Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology
contributing

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
35 year old man with fever, jaundice, RUQ tenderness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology contributing to
his sx
INDICATION: 35-year-old man with fever, jaundice, right upper
quadrant tenderness.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: There is a subtle rounded hyperechoic area seen
adjacent to the right hepatic vein, measuring approximately 2.5
cm in greatest dimension. No definite Doppler flow is seen
within this lesion. No other definite focal lesion is identified
within the liver. Gallbladder appears unremarkable, without
evidence of stones. Normal direction of flow is seen in the
portal vein. Right pleural effusion incidentally noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Subtle hypoechoic lesion seen within the right lobe of the
liver without significant mass effect, possibly representing
focal fatty infiltration, hemangioma or FNH. Multiphasic MRI
(with ""echo-offset"" sequences) or CT is recommended for further
evaluation on a non-emergent basis.
3. Right pleural effusion.

***** [**2172-1-18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. No pericardial effusion
or pathologic flow identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2171**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

***** [**1-25**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please perform w/ PO and IV contrast - hypoechoic liver lesion
on previous US [**2172-1-12**], now w/ elevated LFTs, fever
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Hypoechoic liver lesion on previous ultrasound and
elevated liver function tests.

COMPARISON: An ultrasound of the abdomen from [**2172-1-12**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through
the abdomen and pelvis according to the triphasic liver
protocol. Pre-contrast, arterial face, portovenous phase images
were obtained.

FINDINGS: The liver appears normal with no evidence of abnormal
lesions corresponding to the son[**Name (NI) 493**] finding within the
right lobe. The spleen, the pancreas, and the gallbladder appear
unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal glands are within normal
limits. There is an NG tube in place with the tip seen within
the stomach.

The bowel appears unremarkable with no evidence of pneumatosis
or obstruction. There is no evidence of free fluid within the
abdomen. There is a Foley catheter in place.

There are bilateral basilar atelectases with consolidation in
the right lower lobe. There are also bilateral chest tubes in
place. There is a small right- sided pleural effusion. There is
a subcutaneous collection seen in the right hemithorax more
laterally on image 122 measuring 4.4 anteroposteriorly x 2.5 cm
axially. This collection is surrounded by fat stranding and
inflammatory changes.

There are no suspicious bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is no hepatic lesion detected that would correspond to
the ultrasonographic finding within the right lobe.

2. Bilateral lower lobe atelectases and consolidation within the
right lower lobe with a small effusion. There are bilateral two
chest tubes in place.

3. A collection within the subcutaneous tissues in the lateral
aspect of the right hemithorax with evidence of surrounding
inflammatory changes. Findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
the same day at 6:45 p.m.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77155**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] VATS decortication converted to thoracotomy
with bilateral chest tubes on [**2172-1-14**].  He remained intubated and
was transferred to the SICU postoperatively on empiric
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  He continued to spike fevers with
elevated white count, and his cultures grew out strep viridans
from the pleural fluid and yeast from sputum.  ID was consulted
for antibiotic management, and felt that the yeast was likely a
contaminant.  Echo was done which was negative for vegetations,
and all lines were changed.  On [**1-25**] he had a CT of the
abdomen/pelvis to rule out intraabdominal source, which revealed
a fluid collection below his thoracotomy wound, so the incision
was opened.  Minimal purulent fluid and old clotted blood was
expressed.  Subsequently his fever curve began to trend down,
and pressors and ventilation were weaned.  All subsequent
cultures were negative.  He was extubated on [**1-26**], and
transferred to the floor on [**1-28**].  He [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a speech and
swallow evaluation and was started on PO diet.  His right chest
tube was converted to an empyema tube, and the left chest tube
was pulled on [**2-5**].  There was a small left apical pneumothorax
post-pull which was stable on subsequent xray.  He completed his
course of Zosyn on [**2-4**], but developed C diff colitis so was
started on PO flagyl.  As his vital signs were stable, he was
tolerating regular diet, and was feeling well, he was discharged
to rehab on [**2172-2-6**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1932**] is a 49-year-old right-handed man with a history of
[**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome with intractable epilepsy and
intellectual disability who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 7912**] due to increased lethargy. The staff at his group
home reported that he had been very somnolent over the last few
days. They also reported a cough and some congestion and think
he might have had a fever. He has not had any increase over his
baseline seizure frequency (usually has 1-2 drop attacks per
day). On the morning of admission he was eating breakfast when
he reportedly fell forward and hit his head on the table:
unclear if he fell asleep or had a drop attack. There was no
evidence of convulsive activity. EMS was called and he was taken
to [**Hospital6 33**]. Upon arrival his vitals were within
normal limits (99.1F  77  102/65 16). He received aspirin 81mg
and 1L NS and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be somnolent and
inattentive, not answering questions appropriately and had
difficulty following commands.
Otherwise there were no focal neurologic deficits noted. ROS is
positive for recent cough/congestion, negative for headache,
chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, abdominal
pain, changes in bowel/bladder habits.

Imaging:
CHEST X-RAY ([**2200-3-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph,
there are newly appeared bilateral parenchymal opacities. These
are better seen
on the lateral than on the frontal radiographs and are both
located in the lower lobes. The opacities are ill-defined and
show multiple air bronchograms as well as bronchocentric
predominance. In the appropriate clinical setting, the opacities
are highly suggestive for pneumonia.
.
CTA CHEST ([**2200-3-6**]):
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the distal left main
pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subsegmental
arterial branches. Mild contrast reflux into the IVC suggests
mild right heart strain.
2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, worse at the left lower lobe,
with superimposed pneumonia and/or aspiration.
3. 4 mm right minor fissure nodule, which may represent
inflammatory focus. No dedicated followup is required if there
are no higher risk factors such as malignancy.
4. Small left pleural effusion.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ([**2200-3-7**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
LE ULTRASOUND ([**2200-3-7**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in
either right or left lower extremity.
.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**2200-3-7**]: RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. PO diet: regular
solids, thin liquids. 2. PO meds whole with thin as tolerated,
but whole with puree if
pt has pocketing of meds. 3. [**Hospital1 **] oral care. 4. Assist with meals
only if needed to maintain standard aspiration precautions.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old right-handed man with h/o Lennaux-Gastaut syndrome
with intractable epilepsy and mild intellectual impairment
admitted with a several day history of increased somnolence,
initially felt to be due to upper respiratory tract
infection/anti-epilpetic drug uptitration found to have
pneumonia and bilateral pulmonary emboli requiring transient ICU
admission.
.
#SOMNOLENCE/Community Acquired Pneumonia:
Per the patient's group home, the patient was noted to have
lethargy and cough, but did not have any increase in his
baseline seizure frequency and his neuro exam was unchanged exam
for intermittent subtle twitching of the right thumb. Chest
X-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, which was felt to
be the most likely cause of the patient's somnolence. He was
treated for community acquired pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and
azithromycin and completed his full course of antibiotics in the
hospital.

#Epilepsy:
Patient was maintained on continuous EEG throughout his
hospitalization which showed a slow encephalopathic pattern
throughout the recording with frequent bursts of rapid
generalized epileptiform discharges, consistent with patient's
diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy as well
superimposed toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Per his previous
titration schedule as specified by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his zonegran was
discontinued. His clobazam was initially uptitrated to 10mg/20mg
per previous titration level, then decreased back to 10mg/10mg
due to concern that this could be increasing somnolence. The
rest of his home AED's were continued at their current doses
(Levetiracetam 2500mg [**Hospital1 **], Lacosamide 300mg [**Hospital1 **], Depakote ER
500mg q8am / 750mg q8pm). His somnolence improved with treatment
of his underlying pneumonia. He was followed by Neurology
throughout his hospital course.
.
#PULMONARY EMBOLI:
Although the patient was initially satting in mid-90s on 1-3L
per nasal cannula on admission, while working with physical
therapy on [**3-6**] he had an acute desaturation which required O2 by
50% ventimask to maintain O2 saturation >90%. He was transferred
to the Medical ICU where his antibiotics were initially
broadened to Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin. Chest CTA subsequently
showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the distal left main
pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subsegmental
arterial branches. A transthoracic echocardiogram was done which
showed minimal right heart strain and bilateral lower extremity
ultrasounds showed no DVT. He was treated with anticoagulation
with an IV heparin gtt and transferred to the floor on [**2200-3-8**].
His O2 saturation remained in the high 90s on RA-2L O2 by nasal
canula. After extensive discussion with the Neurology team and
the patient's mother and case worker at his group home, the
decision was made to discharge the patient on a Lovenox bridge
to Coumadin. Given his frequent seizures and falls, it was felt
that Coumadin would be a better option given its ability to be
reversed should the patient suffer a bleed. The interactions of
coumadin with the patient's anti-epileptic drugs were discussed
with the patient's outpatient Neurologist, and the decision was
made to try to manage anticoagulation with coumadin, with
lovenox as a second option should the goal INR of [**2-7**] be
difficult to obtain. Patient should continue on anticoagulation
for 6-12 months and will have INR followed and Coumadin titrated
by the patient's PCP and [**Hospital6 33**] [**Hospital 3052**].   Patient will also require use of a helmet while
ambulating to minimize risk of bleed.
.
#Obstructive sleep apnea: Pt has known OSA for which he has not
tolerated CPAP in the past. Trial of CPAP was performed on the
medical floor which the patient seemed to tolerate however. Pt's
outpatient neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow up and initiate
nasal CPAP as an outpatient.
.
#ANEMIA: Pt has hypoproliferative anemia, HCT was stable
throughout hospitalization. B12 and folate WNL. Iron studies
were relatively normal.

#Disposition: Patient was discharged to rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 1932**],
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2200-3-3**] due to increased somnolence. You were found to have
pneumonia in both lungs, and were started on antibiotics. You
then developed worsening shortness of breath, and were found to
have pulmonary emboli (blood clots in lungs). You were started
on a blood thinner called heparin, and your oxygen requirements
improved. You will need to stay on blood thinners (called
Warfarin) for 6 more months to dissolve the clots. For your
epilepsy, you were put on continuous EEG, which showed changes
due to being sick with pneumonia as well as your underlying
seizure activity. Some of your anti-epileptic medications were
decreased because they seemed to be making you overly
sleepy/lethargic.
.
Please attend the follow up appointments with neurology listed
below.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STARTED Enoxaparin (Lovenox) 120mg subcutaneously once daily,
to be continued until you have therapeutic blood levels of
Warfarin for at least 48 hours
2. STARTED Coumadin (Warfarin) 2mg by mouth daily today, which
will be increased based on what your blood levels are (goal INR
[**2-7**]). These levels will be followed at rehab and then at Dr. [**Name (NI) 17665**] office ([**Hospital3 **]).  You will need to
continue this for at least SIX MONTHS after discharge.
3. STOPPED Zonisamide (Zonegram)
4. DECREASED Clobazam from 10mg in the morning and 20mg at night
to 10mg in the morning and 10mg at night

well as scopolamine patch, and after the case she was extubated
and had a respiratory rate of [**5-13**] with excellent oxygenation.
The floor refused her [**1-8**] low respiratory rate and she was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  [**Name8 (MD) 13042**] RN felt [**Name8 (MD) 14593**] administering
naloxone because the patient was stable and she didn't want to
cause undue pain.

In summary, a 39F with PMH  of anxiety & refractory ulcerative
colitis s/p protocolectomy who came out of the OR too hyponeic
to go to the floor.

Low respiratory drive/rate: Resolved.  This is undoubtedly due
to polypharmacy and is clearing as the meds clear. Patient is
mentating well with SpO2 in high 90s. No indication for narcan
overnight. The patient remained stable throughout her
hospitalization once transferred to the inpatient [**Hospital1 **].

UC s/p Proctocolectomy:  Patient with a PMH of UC from her teen
years, dx'd at 25.  Currently on prednisone taper s/p
proctocolectomy. The patient was progressed from sips of clears
to a regular diet as her bowel function returned. The day prior
to discharge the patient was noted to have increasing ileostomy
output and immodium was initiated. The following day the
ileostomy output was acceptable, she was taught by the
wound/ostomy nursing team as well as the floor nursing team to
care for her ileostomy and how to monitor herself for signs and
symptoms of dehydration and how to measure and record her the
ileostomy output. Her prednisone taper was continued as an
outpatient.

Pain management: As the patient's bowel function returned she
was progressed from intravenous morphine and dilaudid PCA to
pain medications by mouth. The patients pain was adequately
controlled by the discharge pain regimen.

Anxiety: Patient c/o anxiety and concerned she might have a
panic attack. The patient was mantained on her outpatient
regimen of anxiolytics.

which puts you at risk for dehydration if you do not monitor the
output from your ostomy and do not repleate yourself with enough
fluid. It is important to monitor the output from the ostomy.
The goal for your ileostomy output is to  put out between
500cc-1200cc daily. The ileostomy output has been high prior to
your discharge, you have been started on immodium 2mg twice
daily, please take this and monitor your ostomy output. You will
also be taking metamucil wafers as ordered. As your stool
becomes thickened, you may titrate these medications. Please
call the office if you have any questions. Care for your ostomy
as you have been instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. Please

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2262**] was taken to the OR on [**4-30**] for exploratory
laparotomy, resection of gastrojejunostomy and Billroth II
anastomosis, with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, partial transverse
colectomy with primary anastomosis, feeding jejunostomy for
recurrent GIB and history of gastric CA. Postoperatively, the
patient was taken to the SICU for recovery. He was extubated and
did well over the course of POD 0. His hematocrits were stable
in the 26-27 range. His TF were started via the J tube. His NGT
was to suction. On POD 1, he remained hemodynamically stable and
tolerated his tube feeds however his hematocrits started to
slowly decrease. He was transferred to the floor on POD 2 and
given his persistent anemia with a hct of 21, he was transfused
two units of PRBC.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his hematocrit remained
stable in the 30-32 range.  He began tube feeds via his J tube
and tolerated them well.  The speech and swallow service
evaluated him on multiple occasions but he had frank aspiration
on video swallow and therefore was given sips of nectar thick
liquids for comfort. He will need this followed up.

He required mineral oil via his J tube to start his bowel
function and it was effective.  As he is prone to constipation
his narcotic pain medication was stopped and he was given
scheduled Tylenol for pain. He will continue Senna and Colace as
well.

His Surgical wound was healing well and some of his staples were
removed prior to discharge.  The remaining staples will be
removed at his first post op appointment. He had an abdominal CT
on [**2201-5-6**] as he has had a right inguinal hernia nut had a bit
more pain on palpation.  The CT was done and confirmed that the
hernia sac was fat and fluid filled as opposed to bowel and his
pain gradually resolved.

The Physical Therapy service evaluated him and recommended a
stay in a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase
his mobility and endurance after this hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 48yo male with AIDS related [**Doctor Last Name 11579**] Lymphoma
with CNS involvement s/p cycle 2 of R-IVAC admitted with sepsis
and pancytopenia.
.
# Sepsis/ Febrile neutropenia: GNR and methicillin resistant
staph aureus on [**5-5**] blood cultures previously requiring pressors
and course in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Source unclear. Urine cx negative, CT sinus
negative. TTE revealed no evidence of endocarditis with EF
50-55% and mild global systolic dysfunction likely secondary to
sepsis. TEE not completed due to thrombocytopenia. Patient
initially treated with cefepime and vancomycin. As sensitivities
returned, coverage switched to Cipro and vancomycin. Vancomycin
initially dosed by level in setting of acute renal failure. As
renal function improved dosing switched to 1 gram q 12 hours.
PICC line was placed and patient was sent home to complete 3
week course of cipro and 4 weeks total of vancomycin with follow
up by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1075**] from Infectious Disease. Given scripts to
have weekly lab surveillance for Vancomycin including
chemistries and vancomycin levels.

.
# Acute renal failure: urine lytes consistent with prerenal
cause. FeNA 1%. Given IV fluids with improvement. However did
not return to baseline at time of discharge.
.
# Altered mental status: Noted slowing and parkinsonian type
features yesterday. Sent for CT head, revealed subdural
hematomas. Seen by neurosx who felt evacuation not necessary.
Neurology consulted also completed and felt no need for
antiseizure meds at this time. Blood pressure was kept below 140
systolic and repeat CT head showed no progression. Platelets
maintained above 60 and significantly improved prior to
discharge. Parkinsonian features were not completely
attributable to small subdural hematomas. Therefore seroquel
discontinued as patient had cogwheel rigidity which can be a
side effect of seroquel.
.
# C difficile colitis: Stool C difficile toxin positive. Started
on course of flagyl for total of 14 days. However per ID
curbside, patient should be treated for four weeks along with
vancomycin. Therefore, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
appropriate duration of therapy in order to extend the total
course of antibiotics.
.
#Pancytopenia: [**3-5**] recent chemo and complicated by sespis. Hct
drifts downwards w/o transfusions, bone marrow not producing
retics  ANC increased with Neupogen and discontinued when count
rose above 1000.

.
# Oral herpes: Treated with topical acyclovir.
.

#AIDS: Cont home ARV therapy
.
#Hyperglycemia: Insulin SS. Sugars improved as patient recovered
from sepsis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 79 yo male with h/o autonomic neuropathy c/b
orthostatic hypotension, chronic foley, who presented  with
fevers, suprapubic pain, hematuria, and hypotension.  The
following problems were addressed during this hospitalization:
.
#. Sepsis: likely from urinary source. He presented with a
positive UA, suprapubic pain, fever, and hematuria, with chronic
foley. Patient has had a h/o klebsiella and pseudomonas from
previous admission on a urine culture.  Hypotension was
attributed to a combined sepsis/baseline hypotension picture.
He received fluids for pressure support, and had short course of
levophed in the ED.  His foley was changed in the ED.  Following
d/c of the pressor, SBP remained in the mid 90s.  Per the
patient, he has had 70s-90s at home and this is his baseline.
UOP and mental status was closely monitored.  He was begun on
abx tx with cefepime 1 gm IV Q24.  When culture sensitivities
revealed an enterobacter sensitive to ciprofloxacin, the
cefepime was d/c'd and replaced with ciprofloxacin, 750mg [**Hospital1 **]
x14 day course.

#. Hematuria.  This was likely secondary to the patient's UTI.
There was no evidence of foley trauma.  The foley was changed in
the ED.  Hematuria was resolved by the time of transfer from the
MICU to the floor.  The patient has follow up with urology
scheduled for early [**Month (only) **].

#. Autonomic neuropathy: known orthostatic hypotension.  The
patient was continued on midodrine and salt tabs at his outpt
dose.  He was given IVF cautiously as needed.  PT was consulted
to assist him with safe ambulation, and he was able to safely
ambulate with assistance of his walker and his wife at the time
of discharge.

#. h/o SIADH: The patient's sodium remained wnl during the
extent of his hospital course.  It was noted that SIADH has lead
to delerium in the past; no such delirium was noted during this
hospitalization.

# Pancytopenia.  This patient has a history of pancytopenia
which had spontaneously resolved in [**2173**], however, he was noted
to be thrombocytopenic and anemic throughout this
hospitalization.  Further, while his leukocytes were within the
typical normal range, given the extent of his bacteremia, he was
noted to have a relative leukocytopenia with a peak WBC count of
6.2.  All heparin products were held for the last three days of
his hospital stay given the platelet nadir at 95,000.  The
recurrence of pancytopenia is recommended for outpatient follow
up with is PCP and referral to a hematologist as necessary.

Brief Hospital Course:
85M with AF with RVR, in setting of fever and urosepsis with
Afib with RVR.

# Sepsis: Upon admission, patient was febrile with leukocytosis,
left shift, lactate 2.8. UA positive as a likely source. CXR
obtained and negative for infiltrate. Additionally, his abdomen
was soft, non-tender, and guaiac negative.  He was treated with
IV resuscitation 4L and lactate normalized.  Started on
Ceftriaxone 1g q24H with plan to add Vancomycin if clinical
deterioration.  He did not require pressors or central line
placement.  As BPs improved to > 100mmHg systolic, patient was
transefered to medical floor for further management.   He was
noted to have a urine culture positive to Proteus and sensitive
to cephalosporins.  He was initially started on Cefpodoxime but
was then changed to cefuroxime as the mirco-organism was
sensitive to this.  Per discussion with family, his mental
status returned to baseline by HD#3.  He was discharged on 200mg
[**Hospital1 **] of cefpodoxime for an additional 7 days, which may be
switched to 250mg [**Hospital1 **] of Cefuroxime for an additional 7 days if
permitted by pharmacy supplies.  His Blood cultures will require
follow up at [**Hospital1 18**], as they were pending at time of discharge.
He will also require follow up of CBC and LFTs due to start of
the cephalosporin.

# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: In the setting of sepsis and
fever, was felt to be a compensatory rather than primary
cardiac, although patient has not received Diltiazem for 5 days
due to reported hypotension at nursing home.  Given IV fluids as
above.  Started on 30mg TID Diltiazem dosing and a Diltiazem
gtt.  Diltiazem was uptitrated to 60mg QID upon discharge from
ICU and patient remained stable on this during floor stay with
HR in 70-90 range.  This may be uptightrated back to 75mg QID as
HR and BP tolerate.
.
He was not on anticoagulation (stopped after recent admission
with epistaxis as per discussion with PCP).  Given CHADs score
of 3, this was readressed with PCP and was noted that he had
frequent falls at NH, thus would not be a good candidate for
coumadin at this time.  He was started on 81mg ASA daily for
primary prevention of CVA and CAD.

# Acute Renal Failure and Mild Hypernatremia: Initially some
concern for pre-renal as pt appeared dry, vs possible ATN in
setting of prolonged hypotension at NH. Baseline creat 1.1. FeNa
= 1.5 initially suggestive of a likely intrinsic renal
pathology, however Fena was 0.3% on HD3, thus not as reliable.
Cr improved to 1.3 from peak of 2.5 on HD#5.  Patient was
provied with IVF resuscitation with D5W given hypernatremia to
147.  All medications were renally dosed. Na at time of
discharge was 141.

# Anemia: Hct 30.7 and at baseline. Guaiac negative on
admission. Last Fe studies from [**2146**], consistent w/ Fe
defficiency anemia, however anemia is macrocytic and patient on
B12 supplementation. TSH was wnl.  This will require outpatient
follow up with B12, Folate measurements.  Patient was continued
on iron.

# Troponin leak: Patient had troponins of 0.07 in the past and
noted to have 0.04-0.05 in setting of ARF. Likely a leak in
setting of rapid rate.  Enzymes were trended and rate control
was pursued as above.

# Aspiration risk.  Patient noted to have bibasilar
opacifications on CXR preliminary read on [**2147-4-10**] concerning for
possible aspiration.  He was evaluated by speech and swallow,
including video swallow, which did not note overt aspiration,
but deemed high risk due to penetration and however was
recommended PO diet of nectar thick liquids and soft solids with
1:1 supervision, with crushed pills in pure.

Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

GRAYSCALE AND DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE TRANSPLANTED LIVER:
Comparison was made to the ultrasound dated [**2147-3-24**] and CT
scan dated [**2147-3-15**]. There is no focal liver lesion in the
transplanted liver. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal
dilatation. Portal vein is widely patent. There is a ring-like
echogenic structure at the portal vein anastomosis. There is an
anechoic tubular two-compartmental structure, which initially
appeared to be bile duct, however, further scanning revealed it
to be fluid accumulating along the porta hepatis at real- time
scanning. Normal waveforms are seen in main portal vein, main
and left hepatic arteries and three hepatic veins. There is a
small amount of right pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: No intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation in the
transplanted liver. Tubular [**Hospital1 **]-lobed fluid tracking along the
porta hepatis. Small right pleural effusion. Patent portal
veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo man with hx EtOH/HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT in [**5-3**], CMV donor
+, recipient -, now admitted with abdominal pain, fever,
myalgias, headache, cough and found to have CMV viremia with
evidence of liver involvement course complicated by recurrent
HCV seen on biopsy, multifactorial acute renal failure,
microabscesses on biopsy concerning for ascending cholangitis.
.
# CMV Viremia

Original CMV VL [**3-15**] 95,800 at that time started on oral
valganciclovir, biopsy results on [**3-17**] confirmed liver
involvement and he was switched to IV ganciclovir and completed
a 2 week course. His CMV VL decreased to <600 copies on [**3-29**]. He
will need to complete 6 months of oral valganciclovir 450mg
daily for likely 6 months, follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] was
scheduled for patient. Of note he had a negative opthalmologic
examination for retinitis done by opthalmologist.
.

# Transplanted liver

Biopsy shows trichrome stain demonstrates increased portal
fibrosis with septa formation and foci of early bridging
fibrosis (Stage 2-3). Additionally, marked centrivenular
fibrosis without luminal occlusion is seen, indicative of a
component of chronic venous outflow obstruction. Moderate portal
and lobular mixed inflammation consisting of mononuclear cells
and focally prominent neutrophils (some in association with bile
ducts), with microabscess formation and foci of extensive
hemorrhagic necrosis, predominantly involving zone 3.  Scattered
viral inclusions morphologically consistent with cytomegalovirus
are identified within hepatocytes and rare bile ductular
epithelial cells (confirmed by immunostain for CMV, with
satisfactory controls). Recurrent viral hepatitis C, difficult
to grade in this sample. Diagnostic features of acute cellular
rejection are not identified. Biliary findings are also likely a
result of the CMV and/or cytokine-mediated, but a concomitant
bacterial infection, sepsis, a drug effect or biliary
obstruction remain within the histopathologic differential.
Given rising alkaline phosphatase concern for cholestatic
fibrosis was high, he may need repeat liver biopsy in the near
future given his stage 2-3 fibrosis this early into his
transplantation. His Bactrim prophylaxis was switched to Dapone
given his renal dysfunction, G6PD level was normal.
.

# Acute kidney injury

Multifactorial etiology in this patient with a baseline 1-1.2,
he had component of cryoglobulinemia given positive cryos on
[**3-15**] and [**3-27**] with 3 an 2 percent crycrit respectively. He was
started back on interferon and ribavirin on [**3-25**], ribavirin was
subsequently held given rise in creatinine. His urine did not
reveal proteinuria and had nonspecific granular casts.
Tacrolimus nephrotoxicity was considered and his goal was
reduced to [**5-3**]. His creatinine peaked at 2.1 and decreased, at
discharge his creatinine was... Of note he did receive fluid
challenges with no improvement in renal function given that his
PO intake was poor. His Bactrim was switched to Dapone given his
renal dysfunction, G6PD level was normal.
.

# Superimposed bacterial infection

Had recurrent fevers while on treatment for CMV, biopsy revealed
microabscesses concerning for ascending cholangitis. Patient is
to complete 3 week course of levaquin and flagyl on [**4-6**], he did
not spike any fevers while on this regimen. initially was on
vancomycin for possible pneumonia, susbsequent radiograph was
unrevealing. Patient had recurrent headache for which he had a
negative lumbar puncture, all other cultures were negative.
.

# Normocytic anemia

Multifactorial due to chronic disease, likely small oozing from
CMV colitis (not biopsied or colonoscopy), had EGD showing
gastric erosion consistent with gastritis, no CMV. On multiple
myelosuppressive medications. He was transfused for
hematocrit<21. Hematology reviewed smear and was not concerning
for TTP. He is on Epogen during his HCV treatment.
.

# Inflammatory arthritis

Seen by rheumatology who tapped his swollen right knee, there
was no evidence of infection and the fluid was inflammatory.
This was attributed to cryoglobulinemia and his myalgias and
arthralgias resolved throughout his hospital course.
.

# Hypertension

His metoprolol was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect.

[**Last Name (un) **]), CAD, Pulm HTN, UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy, who
presents for shortness of breath and mental status changes. She
was brought to the ED  by her husband and family. She and the
family report an increased ostomy output for the past several
days, without specific quantification. She does have some new
crampy lower abdominal pain which is new for her.



The shortness of breath is worse with exertion and especially
going up stairs, as well as worsened by supine position, but
this has been building for about one month. She specifically
denies chest pain or discomfort.



She was recently admitted to the medical service [**Date range (1) 24726**]
for UTI, and treated with ciprofloxacin.



She continues to have b/l LE swelling and edema with superficial
redness. On her left medial/inner thigh, she has a larger patch
of hyperemetous skin with development of papules, also seen on
her prior admission and treated with topical fungal medication.



She takes PRN tylenol 4-6 per day by report. No other new

Pertinent Results:
Bicarb

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and
ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap academia in setting of
increased ostomy output and some worsening of renal failure.

Anion Gap Acidosis.  delta delta initially favoring slight mixed
gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy
output .  Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens)
likely related to CKD and possibly RTA.  Urine lytes and gap c/w
RTA.
-  Hold further bicarb IV for now, likely restart PO bicarb.
will d/w renal.
-  Management of CKD below.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
Worsened 3.0 ?????? 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output
according to the patient and husband.  Now with improvement to
3.3.
- Awaiting renal's decision re: initiation of HD timing
- If HD this admit will need access; likely tunneled line; has
seen transplant as outpatient for access options.

INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
- consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare
to have enteritis without colon.

- Continue IV flagyl for now

- Check stool culture and c.diff (2nd today).


ANEMIA.  Dropping steadily since admit; hct 22 today (30 at
admit).  No obvious bleeding source or hematoma.  Baseline B12
deficiency (repleted), MDS, CKD.
- check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past per
notes from several years ago)
-  T&S, would not transfuse unless <21
-  Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
- Guaiac ostomy output.

DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need
for significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.
 Lungs clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.
- Treatment of acidosis as above

&#9658; CELLULITIS.  unclear if this is a new finding of
infection or related to venous stasis.  Was being managed by
derm as outpatient for venous stasis.
- Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, would continue given
her improvement. Add on vanco level today
- Continue topical antifungal powder
- Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections - done, negative for
collections.

UTI.  +U/A, cipro started.  Culture not sent at the time of UA
- check culture
- continue cipro x ~7 day course.

MACROCYTOSIS.  Ongoing x years.  Does have history of B12
deficiency, getting monthly IM replacement and normal B12 (and
folate) levels here.  Also with history of ?MDS, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] in the past.

HYPERTENSION. Normotensive currently
- Holding CCBs with peripheral edema; will monitor today and
possible restart.

CAD
-  ?On aspirin daily ?????? will check into

GERD

- continue protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (on at home)

MICU Course:
Patient noted to have shortness of breath in setting of low
bicarb and ongoing diarrhea.  Likely secondary to worsening
renal failure and increased ostomy output.  Patient initially
treated with IV bicarb, but as bicarb corrected, this was
stopped.  Noted to have elevated WBC so treated with vanco for
cellulitis (b/l thigh cellulitis clinically improving on vanco),
cipro for positive ua (UCx not sent), and flagyl for increased
ostomy output (though patient is s/p colectomy for UC which has
improved with flagyl).  Renal is still deciding whether or not
dialysis will be initiated.

stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Trivial TR. Trivial PI.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post_Bypass:
The patient is in sinus rhythm on a phenylephrine infusion, with
a cardiac output of 5.5L/min.
The biventricular systolic function is preserved (hyperdynamic
LV).
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.
Trace to Mild MR.
[**First Name (Titles) 88610**] [**Last Name (Titles) 72424**] 50%. Preserved RV systolic function.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2168-4-18**] where the patient underwent Emergent
coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending
artery, and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the right coronary
artery, first obtuse marginal artery and second obtuse marginal
artery. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well  and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring on low dose
vasopressors. The patient was extubated POD1, alert, oriented
and breathing comfortably. She was neurologically intact. She
was transfused 2 units of PRBC for HCT 24 to 29.0  She titrated
off pressors with SBP 95-100 hemodynamically stable. Low dose
beta-blockers were initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication. The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home with VNA services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, tylenol overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
22 F with history of ETOH abuse, IVDU of heroin, cocaine, and
unknown street drugs, bipolar disorder, transferred from [**Location (un) **] hospital with tylenol overdose. (The patient was not able to
give much of this history because of drowsiness, so much of this
history was given by her mother.) She took 15 tylenol pm last
night, sometime between evening and midnight. She usually takes
4 tylenol PM every night to help her sleep, but last night she
couldn't sleep, so she took 15 tylenol PM. According to her
mother, she took klonepin yesterday as well (her daughter had
told her she had taken it), but she doesn't know the amount.
Patient does not take any medications on home regimen.
.
According to the patient and her mother, the patient was not
taking 15 tylenol PM as a suicide attempt. The patient states
that she did not wish to hurt herself, but took the pills
because she couldn't sleep or rest. She said she usually takes
Tylenol PM and thought that taking more pills would increase the
effect of helping her sleep. She reports abdominal pain, aching
in her muscles ""all over"", sleepiness, ""feel like I have the
flu"".
.
Her mother had actually taken her to [**Hospital3 **] hospital 2 days
ago, on Sunday afternoon at 2:30 pm, because she was ""acting
funny"", sitting on the floor, not answering questions, looking
disheveled, acting belligerent and temperamental, which is very
uncharacteristic for the patient per mother. [**Name (NI) **] mother states
that her daughter ""can be really difficult, but is the type who
will never leave the house without a perfectly matched outfit
and makeup"". Her boyfriend and mother assumed that she was
""strung out on drugs"". She was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital on Sunday at 2:30 pm and returned home by 7:30 pm from
the hospital. Her mother does not know what transpired during
her ED visit on Sunday. She was not with her daughter during
that hospital visit, but after she returned from the hospital,
her daughter seemed more back to her normal self per mother.
.
Late on Monday night, mother called ambulance since patient
seemed obtunded and ill. At OSH, she had vomiting, dry heaves,
nausea, restlessness; she was given zofran 8 mg IV. EMS found BG
32, was given D25; BG 162 on arrival to OSH; BG decreased to 70
and was given D50 on floor. AST >10,000, ALT >5,000, Cr 2.13,
TBili 4.8, DBili 2.9, Alk phos 127. ABG: 7.32 / 24 / 121 / 12 on
2L nc. She had an abdominal US and was found to have liver and
renal failure. She received NAC 7g load plus 2.5g by 4 am
Tuesday before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were T 97.7, HR 132, 105/47, RR 26, 100%
3L nc on admission. Hepatology was consulted and recommended 17
mg/kg/hr IV NAC infusion. Toxicology was also consulted. INR
14.1, liver enzymes pending, acetaminophen level was negative.
Received 2250 ml NS in ED, received [**2106**] ml NS at OSH. She was
transferred to MICU Green.
.
In subsequent information obtained from the patient's mother in
private: the patient has a history of bipolar disorder, she has
tried to slash her wrists in past suicide attempts, she refuses
all treatment and is noncompliant with medical recommendations
and medications, she has signed AMA out of a psychiatry
hospital, she has boyfriend with Hepatitis C, and she takes
heroin or any IV drugs whenever she has access.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Patient cannot answer questions due to obtundation. +abdominal
pain. +generalized pain which does not localize. No fever, no
chills, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no blood per rectum.

Past Medical History:
- ETOH abuse: 60 beers + 1 bottle rum + 1 bottle jagermeister
per week
- Hepatitis C
- Chronic tylenol PM use: 4 pills per night for at least the
past few years
- IV drug use: heroin, cocaine, possibly other drugs
- Illicit drug use: unprescribed klonepin, percocet
- Bipolar disorder: refuses medical treatment and signed out AMA
from psychiatric [**Hospital1 **]
- Previous suicide attempts: slashing wrists

Social History:
ETOH: Per mother, she drinks 60 beers (""at least two 30-packs""),
a bottle of rum, and some jagermeister per week. Her mother
estimates that the amount is more than that, since that is what
she witnesses herself, but she does not see what her daughter
drinks when she is out of the house. She drinks a beer every
morning before going to work, and she often skips work because
she is inebriated.
.
IV drugs: Per mother and patient, she has used heroin and
cocaine in the past.
.
Other drugs: She has a history of using percocet and klonopin
for non-medical reasons and without a prescription. Her mother
reports that it is very easy to gain access to these drugs in
her neighborhood.
.
ADLs: She works as a roofer for her father. She shows up to work
approximately 10-15 days out of each month because of her ETOH
and drug use, but she is able to keep her job because she works
for her father. She lives at home with her mother, who works
nights. Her mother states that ""it's impossible to keep track of
her"" and feels that since she is an adult at 22, she can lead
her own life. She has a boyfriend who has hepatitis C. She has
not been tested for HIV or hepatitis.

CXR [**2114-3-29**]:
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The left internal
jugular line tip is terminating in the low SVC. There is no
pneumothorax or apical hematoma identified. The NG tube tip
terminates in the stomach.
There is no significant change in bilateral perihilar and lower
lobe consolidations. Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be
excluded though there is no evidence of large pleural fluid.
.
CT Head/Chest/Abd/Pelv [**2114-3-29**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is diffuse edema of the brain
parenchyma with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation and
obliteration of the ventricular system. There is also
obliteration of all basilar cisterns. Obliteration of the pre-
mesencephalic space suggests bilateral uncal herniation.
Complete obliteration of ambient cistern suggests transtentorial
herniation. There is also complete obliteration of CSF space at
foramen magnum suggesting tonsillar herniation. No focal mass
lesion is seen. No major or minor vascular territorial infarct
is detected. No shift of normal midline structure is seen.
The surrounding bony and soft tissue structures are unremarkable
with no evidence of fracture. The maxillary sinuses are
normal.The ethmoid sinuses , frontal sinuses and Sphenoid
sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION: Severe diffuse brain edema with obliteration of all
CSF spaces with uncal, downward transtentorial and tonsillar
herniation.
.
CT chest [**2114-3-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute bleeding is seen within the chest,
abdomen or pelvis to explain the patient unresponsiveness.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left
side.
3. Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations, centered
on the bronchovascular bundle, which may suggest aspiration
pneumonitis.
4. Anasarca and ascites.
.
TTE [**2114-3-27**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
gradient is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function. Resting
tachycardia. No obvious structural valvular disease but
evaluation limited due to marked tachycardia.
.
Abdomen US [**2114-3-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal-appearing liver without focal lesion identified.
2. Diffuse bilateral renal cortical echogenicity consistent with
diffuse parenchymal disease.
3. Gallbladder wall edema without evidence of acute
cholecystitis which may be seen with liver disease and
hypoalbuminemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
22 F with history of heavy ETOH abuse, HCV, IVDU of heroin,
cocaine, and unknown street drugs, bipolar disorder, transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and admitted to MICU with tylenol
overdose, renal failure, and altered mental status, improved for
the first 3 days, then evolved to brain death due to brain
herniation.
.
# Acute fulminant liver failure:
Patient has a history of heavy ETOH abuse, HCV, with fulminant
liver failure precipitated by tylenol overdose. MELD was 50 with
a 98% predicted mortality on admission. Acetaminophen level was
negative, AST [**Numeric Identifier 29620**], ALT 9260, INR 14.1, TB 4.2 on admission.
She had been loaded with N-acetylcysteine IV infusion at [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital, and then was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Hepatology consult and Toxicology consult were called and gave
initial recommendations on NAC dosing.
.
In the MICU, 17 mg/kg/hr NAC per hour was started at the time of
admission. Her initial workup covered viruses, toxins, drugs,
autoimmune, shock liver, hemochromatosis, liver cancer, and
sepsis as an alternative impetus for liver failure. She was HBV
immune (HBsAb positive), HCV Ab positive, HIV negative, CMV
negative, Monospot negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, AFP negative, TIBC
low (229), ferritin >[**2106**] (inflammation). Urine toxin screen was
positive for cocaine. Serum toxin screen was negative (included
opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines). TTE was ordered to assess
possibility of shock liver, in addition to assessment of flow
murmur on exam; TTE showed hyperdynamic LV systolic function
with EF > 75%. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Patient was guaiac
positive with brown stool in the vault. Free calcium was 0.85
and was aggressively repleted. Normal serum glucose was
maintained with D50 and slow D5W infusion.
.
Hepatology consult assessed that the patient would not be a
liver transplant candidate, due to her continued heavy ETOH
abuse, continued illicit IV drug use, nonprescribed heavy
klonepin and percocet use, and previous consistent refusal of
medical treatment and recommendations (history of signing out
against medical advice from hospitals). This plan was discussed
with her mother, father, aunt, and family, who understood and
agreed.
.
MICU and hepatology team discussed intracranial pressure
monitoring using a bolt, and it was agreed that no bolt would be
placed, as patient was not a liver transplant candidate.
Neurologic exam was performed every hour. Her neurologic exam on
admission showed pupils constricting briskly 4 to 3 mm on the
right and 4 to 3 mm on the left, and she was drowsy but oriented
to person, place, year. She required a high dose of propofol to
maintain proper sedation. On [**3-28**], when sedation was turned down
to test mental status, she withdrew appropriately to painful
stimuli, and pupils were briskly reactive.
.
The patient had an episode of vomiting and for concern of airway
protection and aspiration, she was sedated, intubated, and LIJ
central line and arterial line was placed [**3-28**]. She was noted to
have diffuse ecchymoses over the eyelids, behind her ears, and
on bilateral abdomen, thought to be secondary to coagulopathy.
This elicited concern for a retroperitoneal bleed, but since
patient was not a candidate for surgical repair at the time, and
since the patient's clinical status was very tenuous and she was
not safe to leave the ICU, CT was not performed at this time.
.
On [**3-29**] AM, sedation was turned down to test mental status, and
she withdrew more slowly to painful stimuli, and pupils were
still equally reactive. Ecchymoses had expanded anteriorly over
abdomen, but abdomen was soft with bowel sounds and hematocrit
was maintained > 21 with pRBC transfusions. On [**3-29**] AM, with no
change in medications or sedation for the past hour, she was
noted to have sudden spike of BP >200/>110 and HR 150s. She was
given ativan 1 mg IV and labetalol 10 IV and her BP immediately
returned to 110/60 and HR 70s. Neurologic exam was performed and
vitals were measured every hour with no change.
.
On [**3-29**] early afternoon, neurologic exam suddenly showed right
pupil 5 mm nonreactive and left pupil slow to react 4 to 3 mm.
Sedation was turned off and patient no longer reacted to painful
stimuli. Mannitol and CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis were
ordered. Within minutes, the patient's pupils became fixed and
dilated. CT head showed uncal, transtentorial, and tonsillar
herniation. Neurology reported brain death on [**3-29**]. Organ bank
assessed patient as candidate for heart donation only due to
hepatitis C. The patient was subsequently given further support
for cardiac care for organ donation from [**3-29**] to [**3-30**].
.
# Coagulopathy/bleeding:
Since admission, her hematocrit continued to decrease and her
INR continued to increase. She received a total of 4 pRBC, 12
FFP, and 1 cryoprecipitate transfusions over 3 days before
death. INR was initially 14.1 and was maintained with a goal INR
< 4.0; cryoprecipitate was given for fibrinogen < 100; RBC
transfusion was given for hematocrit < 21 or for an acute drop.
.
# Respiratory insufficiency:
The patient was hyperventilating with large tidal volumes. She
was intubated and on AC after an episode of vomiting, for airway
protection. CXR showed bilateral basilar infiltrates concerning
for early acute lung injury versus aspiration, and patient was
started on levofloxacin to cover for possible aspiration
pneumonia.
.
# ETOH/opiate withdrawal:
She was on propofol gtt which controlled withdrawal well. On [**3-29**]
AM, she had one episode of BP 200/110, HR 150s. She was given
ativan 1 mg IV and labetalol 10 IV with immediate resolution.
.
# Renal failure:
She received several boluses of NS IVF for prerenal azotemia and
Cr 2.5 on admission with no Cr baseline. Her renal function
worsened and renal was consulted on [**3-28**]. Urine output was
sufficient, and she did not require HD or CVVH. She was placed
on a phosphate binder. It was possible that her renal failure
occurred in conjunction with liver failure and/or was associated
with cocaine-induced vasoconstriction.
.
# Hematemesis:
Patient had small coffee ground gastric fluid and orogastric
tube was placed to low suction. She was placed on pantoprazole
IV BID.
.
# Leukocytosis:
WBC 23.1 on admission resolved to 6.3 after one day. Antibiotics
were started on [**3-28**] due to CXR infiltrates. Blood cultures on
[**3-27**] showed positive gram stain, and on [**3-31**] and [**4-2**] grew out
Corynebacterium species and Fusobacterium nucleatum, beta
lactamase negative. Surveillance blood cultures on [**3-28**] and [**3-29**]
showed no growth or were still pending (no growth yet) by [**4-3**].
Sputum cultures on [**3-28**] grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae and
MSSA on [**4-2**], both sensitive to levofloxacin. Urine culture
showed 1000 organisms of gram positive organism, likely
staphylococcus.
.
# Hypoglycemia:
Patient had one episode of fingerstick glucose 32, and was given
D50. D5W infusion was continued with subsequent normal
fingerstick glucose readings, which were checked every hour.
.
# Prophylaxis:
She was placed on pneumoboots with no subcutaneous heparin. She
was given PPI IV BID for hematemesis.
.
# Code:
Her code was full until her death on [**3-29**].

Pertinent Results:
[**9-1**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Complex heterogeneous right subdural
collection suggestive of mostly subacute subdural hematoma with
areas of hyperdensity which may indicate more acute component.
Right-to-left subfalcine herniation. 9 mm rightward shift of
septum pellucidum.

[**2199-9-1**] CXR
AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate clear lungs
without
effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The
mediastinal contours
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Normal chest.

CT head [**2199-9-3**]
Post-surgical changes from recent right frontoparietal
craniotomy with
right-sided drainage catheter in the surgical bed. The degree of
subfalcine herniation, sulcal effacement and local mass effect
appears slightly improved compared to most recent examination.

CXR [**2199-9-3**]
In comparison with the study of [**9-1**], there has been placement of
an
endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the
carina.
Nasogastric tube tip appears to extend only to the upper portion
of the
stomach with the side hole within the lower esophagus. Low lung
volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse
diameter of the heart.


CT head [**2199-9-4**]
 Slight increase in size of previously noted acute subdural
hematoma, no change in midline shift.

CT Head [**9-5**]
 No change when compared to previous scan on [**9-4**]

LENIs [**9-9**] - negative for DVT.

CT Head [**9-10**] (post op)
1. Decreased size of right subdural hematoma with decreased mass
effect.

2. New subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and
right frontal sulci.

CT Head [**9-12**]

 Slight increase in right frontal wedge-shaped hypodensity with
mild increase in size likely related to evolution without a
significant increase in mass effect. Decrease in the previously
noted right sided subdural fluid collection with dense foci. No
new hemorrhage.

Carotid US [**2199-9-17**]
No evidence of significant carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.

Echocardiogram [**2199-9-18**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased peak transvalvular velocity consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified. Preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Compared with the prior study dated
[**2193-6-5**] (images unavailable for review), minimal aortic valve
stenosis is appreciated.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**9-1**] Mr. [**Known lastname 45777**] was admitted to the neuro ICU and started on
Keppra for seizure prophylaxsis. He remained stable
neurologically and radiologically and was cleared for transfer
to the floor on [**9-2**]. Surgery was scheduled for [**9-3**] for
craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma. Preop and consent were
obtained. He proceeded to the OR on [**2199-9-3**] for a right
craniotomy for subdural evacuation. A JP drain was left in
place. He remained intubated post-op and he went to CT for a
scan that showed some acute blood. He has left sided weakness.
He was transfered to the NICU. On [**2199-9-4**], he was extubated and
his strength was slowly improving. CT head showed a small amount
of acute blood and he was given platelets. In total he received
2 units of platelets and his platelet count remained above 100k.
A repeat CT head on [**9-5**] showed no change when compared to
previous scan. His subdural drain remained in place and was
removed in the late afternoon. He was transferred to a step-down
bed from the SICU that evening. The morning of [**9-6**] the patient
had a repeat Head CT demonstrating no change in right
frontoparietal hyperdensity and no new hemorrhage. The patient
mental status waxed and waned over the course of the day.
Patient failed speech and swallow and it was recommended to keep
the patient NPO. NG tube was placed in order to get medications
and nutrition.

On [**9-9**] LENIs was obtained to rule out DVT which was essentially
negative.  A repeat Head CT showed slight increase in right
Frontoparietal collection.  As a result, a Brain MRI Stroke
protocol was obtained as he had not improved neurologically
which demonstrated no brainstem hemorrhage. [**9-10**] MRI head
demonstrated the right frontoparietal subdural and subarachnoid
hemorrhage with mass effect and midline shift which are
unchanged as compared to the prior CT scan. He was taken to the
OR on [**9-10**] for a redo right craniotomy for SDH evacuation. A
post-op CT showed improvement with a decreased size of right
subdural hematoma with decreased mass effect and a new
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and right
frontal sulci. The patient was taken to SICU-B after surgery
intubated. He remained intubated in the morning [**9-11**] with
reported seizure activity (right arm and right downward gaze
fixation) treated with increased keppra and continuous EEG. The
patient was also pan cultured for fever. A CT-scan was
re-ordered demonstrating a right frontal infarct. Dilantin was
added to seizure prophylaxis. Vancomycin, tobramycin, and
cefepime were added after Bronch cx returned positive for gram
positive rods and cocci and gram negative rods. Urine cultures
returned positive for Enterococcus. The patient remained
intubated with no change in neuro exam overnight. Patient
continued to have febrile temperatures overnight.  The morning
of [**9-12**], the patient continued to have seizure episodes.
Neuroepilepsy was consulted for seizure work-up and
recommendations, endocrine service was consulted for work-up of
endocrine issues and recommendations, and a repeat head CT was
ordered. Patient was overnight without seizures and afebrile
throughout [**9-13**]. Urine cultures and bronchalveolar lavage
cultures returned with antibiotic sensitivities; antibiotics
were tailored as per sensitivity testing. The patient continued
to progress in his physical exam with increased movement in his
right upper and lower extremit, minimal movement of left upper
extremity and withdrawal to pain on left lower extremity,
following commands, and opening his eyes to voice. The plan was
to begin considering possible extubation.

On [**9-14**], the patient continued in the Surgical intensive care
unit.  The ventilator was weaned and the patient was extubated.
The patient was weak, but opened his eyes to voice and was
oriented to person place and time.  The patient was able to move
all four extremities antigravity to command.  The patient moves
the left arm and leg after a delay.  The left side is weakner
than the right.  The patient had a bowel movement.

On [**9-16**] pt was doing well. He was AOx3 and was more interactive
with staff and family. He was transferred to the SDU in stable
condition. His abx were narrowed to Cefepime and the plan was to
continue for a total fo 14 days.
On [**9-17**] a carotid US was done per Neuro-Vascular service and
there was no significant stenosis. He was changed to floor
status.

On [**9-18**] his calcium was repleted. He was neurologically stable.
Cefepime was changed to Bactrim for oral therapy. IV meds were
discontinued. He was approved for PT.
Central line was discontinued. Patient taking oral intake
without issues. Overnight, the patient had no complaints.
Patient did take out dobbhoff tube despite restraints.
His echo was without source of embolus.

On [**9-19**] the patient was without complaints. His neurologic exam
was stable and strength in left upper and lower extremities
progressed. Patient's restraints were discontinued. Lasix were
given for signs of fluid overload in lower extremities.  His
staple were removed in routine fashion.  Now DOD, he is
afebrile, VSS, and he himproved neurologically.  He is
tolerating an oral diet without issues.  He was evaluated by
pt/ot/speech who recommended rehab.  On [**2199-9-19**],  He was stable
for discharge to rehab and will f/u accordingly.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ptx
STUDY: Single portable AP chest radiograph.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, please
evaluate for pneumothorax
COMPARISON: [**2124-7-5**].

FINDINGS: Study is limited by tubing from breathing mask
overlying the right apex which is the region of interest. Subtle
lucency remains in this area, however, exact extent of right
apical pneumothorax is indeterminate. There is no shift in the
mediastinum to suggest a tension component. The lungs are
otherwise clear. There is a small left pleural effusion. Median
sternotomy wires remain intact.
IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph given overlying tubing in the
right apex. However, there is likely unchanged to slight
improvement of right apical pneumothorax and repeat radiograph
is recommended after overlying tubing has been removed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into
the RV. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma
in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is hypokinesis
of the mid to apical segments of the septal and lateral walls).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral valve prolapse of the anterior and posterior leaflets. An
posteriorly eccentric, directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation and a centrally directed jet is seen . The
mitral valve annulus is dilated measurng 4.5 cm in the
transcommisural view and 5.4cm in the anterior-posterior view.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine and
phenylephrine and was in a sinus rhythm.
1. There is a mitral valve ring in place, gradient across the
mitral valve is1mmHg with a CO of 3.5L/min. The PHT 47ms, with a
MVA of 2.4cm2.
2. There is global left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an
estimated LVEF of 35 %.
3. Right ventricular systolic function is abnormal; the RV
appears moderatly dilated and moderately hypokinetic
post-bypass.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation..
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

IMAGING:
[**6-23**] CXR: ETT in place. NGT to be advanced
[**6-23**] NC Head CT: No intracranial process
[**6-23**]: Abd/ Pelvis CT w/o contrast: Fat stranding surrounding the
tail of the pancreas, with thickening and stranding of the left
anterior pararenal fascia, most compatible with pancreatitis.
Bilateral nephograms, concerning for acute renal failure,
although there is some continued excretion into the ureters.
Trace free fluid within the abdomen. No loculated collections

the AM. He had a recent hospitalization for MI and PNA, and had
completed a 2 week course of PNA on Sunday. At home, he denied
any F, C, N/V, but endorsed pleureitic L sided chest pain and
shortness of breath.
.
He initally was taken to [**Hospital3 **], and was given nitro
gtt, briefly was on a heparin gtt, and was given Levofloxacin
for a worsening LLL PNA. The plan was then to transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
since this is where he receives his cardiology care, for sats
70's-80's on facemask prior to switching to nrb, then improved
to low 90s for a cards evalulation. While he was in the
ambulance, radiology at [**Location (un) **] stat notified our ED of a
finding of a 30% left PTX. The ambulance was thus directed to
the nearest hospital, which turned out to be [**Hospital1 **]. At
[**Hospital1 **], his left PTX was relieved with a Heimlich valve device,
which on our repeat CXR shows resolution. The patient then
reported improved SOB, but still some mild L CP with
inspiration.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  99.0 110 170/91 20 98% cont neb

[**2120-2-26**] 08:35PM   PT-14.5* PTT-37.2* INR(PT)-1.4*

CXR [**2-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, raises
concern for an infection/pneumonia and/or aspiration. Blunting
of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.

A tubular structure/catheter extending into the left lung apex
with possible tiny left apical pneumothorax remaining. However,
suggest followup with removal of external artifact for better
evaluation. Upright PA and lateral views may be helpful for
further evaluation when/if patient able.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2120-2-28**]
The left pigtail is in place. The left lower lobe consolidation
has
substantially improved. Heart size and mediastinum are overall
unchanged.
The assessment of the lung bases still demonstrate bilateral
pleural effusion, small on the right and most likely small to
moderate on the left.



Brief Hospital Course:
85M with a PMh s/f severe COPD on chronic O2, complete heart
block s/p PMP [**7-21**], PVD s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies
in [**2111**], HTN, HLD presents with pleuritic pain and found to have
a L PTX.

# PTX/Chest Pain: Has remained hemodynamically stable since
arrival to the hosptial. Has a Heimlich valve device in place,
and is oxygenating well, without new development of PTX. Most
likely the pt developed a PTX from the bursting of a bleb as a
complication of severe COPD. The pt was ruled out for an MI with
CE. He was weaned down to 2L of O2 NC which is his home O2
requirement. Interventional pulmonology removed the Heimlich
valve without complication.
.
# LLL infiltrate: CXR this hospitalization shows a LLL opacity.
The pt just completed a two week course of antibiotics
prescribed by his PCP for treatment of pneumonia. The pt was
afebrile, without a leukocytosis and cough. There was no
evidence of infection currently and most likely this
radiographic reminence from resolving prior pneumonia. No
further antibiotics were given during this hospitalization.
.
# Acute Urinary Retention: The pt has known BPH and is on
Terazosin at home. He claims that for prior hospitalizations he
has required urinary catheterization for obstruction as well. He
was having difficulty voiding during this hospitalization. A
bladder scan revealed >1L of urine in his bladder. A foley
catheter was placed to relieve this obstruction. It was then
removed and a repeat voiding trial was obtained which showed him
to be retaining 600cc of urine in his bladder. A foley catheter
was re-inserted and a follow up appointment was made with
Urology for removal. We increased his dose of Terazosin from 2mg
to 5mg daily prior to discharge.
.
# Severe COPD on chronic oxygen treatment: Patient was quickly
weaned back down to home O2 requirements (2-3L 02 NC), without
any extra wheezing on exam.  We continued his home Advair,
Tiotroprium and nebulizers prn.
.
# Elevated INR: Chronic problem noted in this pt seen on labs
from [**2111**] where is INR was also noted to be 1.4. Pt is not on
warfarin currently. His albumin was wnl and there was no active
signs of bleeding.
.
# Hyperlipidemia/PVD: We continued
aspirin 81 mg Daily
Plavix 75 mg Daily
Zocor 10 mg Daily
Lisinopril 10 mg Daily
.
# Chronic Lower Extremity Edema- we continued
Lasix 20 mg QAM
Lasix 10 mg QPM
.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: continued
Mirapex 0.5 mg QHS
.
# Transitional- Prior to discharge a urinary catheter was placed
to relieve his urinary obstruction from BPH. He has a follow up
appointment with urology to have this removed. He also has a
follow up appointment with his PCP as well.

[**5-18**] EKG
Probable sinus tachycardia. Prominent precordial lead QRS
voltage raises
the consideration of left ventricular hypertrophy, although is
non-diagnostic.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**5-18**] CT head
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial edema, mass effect, or
vascular
territorial infarction. An ovoid hyperdensity overlies the
cribriform plates
and measures 14 x 14mm (2:9), possibly representing a
meningioma. Ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and in configuration. Extracranial
soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. Mild mucosal soft tissue thickening
is noted at
the right maxillary sinus. Fluid in the posterior nasopharynx
extends into the
ethmoid air cells bilaterally. Otherwise, the paranasal sinuses
and mastoid
air cells are clear. There is no fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1) Extra-axial ovoid hyperdensity overlying the cribriform
plates, without mass effect, possibly representing a meningioma.
Further characterization with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended.


2) No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**5-18**] CT C-spine w/o contrast:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial edema, mass effect, or

territorial infarction. An ovoid hyperdensity overlies the
cribriform plates and measures 14 x 14mm (2:9), possibly
representing a meningioma. Ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and in configuration. Extracranial soft tissue structures
are unremarkable. Mild mucosal soft tissue thickening is noted
at the right maxillary sinus. Fluid in the posterior nasopharynx

Further characterization with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended.


2) No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**5-19**] Liver U/S
FINDINGS: Examination is somewhat limited due to difficulty with
patient
positioning as well as overlying bowel gas. Allowing for this
limitation, liver is diffusely echogenic without focal lesion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. Common
bile duct measures 6 mm in caliber. There are no gallstones.
Pancreas is not well visualized. There is no ascites. Spleen is
not enlarged measuring 8.2 cm in length.

The main portal vein is patent and demonstrates antegrade flow.
Velocity
within the main portal vein measures 17.4 cm/sec. Flow within
the right
portal vein is noted and is antegrade. Flow within the left
portal vein is reversed, compatible with portal hypertension.
SMV and splenic vein are patent.

IVC, right hepatic vein, left hepatic vein, and middle hepatic
vein are all patent and unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver, commonly seen with fatty
infiltration. Other, more advanced forms of liver disease such
as cirrhosis or fibrosis can have a similar appearance and
cannot be completely excluded by ultrasound.
2. Flow reversal within the left portal vein, compatible with
portal
hypertension. Flow within the main portal vein is antegrade.
There is no
splenomegaly or ascites.

[**5-19**] CXR

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-18**], the endotracheal
tube remains about 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is
coiled in the stomach with the tip projected close to the
cardioesophageal junction. The lungs are essentially clear and
there is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.

.
[**5-20**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and
sleeping
states. The generalized low voltage fast beta rhythms may be
seen with
medication side effects (e.g. benzodiazepines and barbiturates)
or may
be seen with anxiety. No focal slowing, epileptiform discharges
or
electrographic seizures were recorded.
.
EGD - [**5-19**] Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Erythema, congestion,
petechiae and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible
with portal hypertensive gastropathy (endoclip). Normal mucosa
in the duodenum. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the
duodenum
Recommendations: Avoid all NSAIDS and [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitors. Take
tylenol for pain (max of 2 grams per day). D/C octreotide.
Continue PPI IV BID.
.
MRI:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, midline
shift, or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are prominent for age
suggesting
atrophy. There is right maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. No
diffusion
abnormalities are seen. Overlying the cribriform plate is a T1
bright 12 x 16-mm oval structure (series 3, image 10) which
loses signal on fat
suppression. The intracranial and vertebral and internal carotid
arteries and their major branches appear normal without evidence
of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. No infarct or acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Incidental note made of a lipoma adjacent to the cribriform
plate.
3. Atrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 46 year old man with history of traumatic
brain injury and alcohol abuse now with new onset tonic clonic
seizures, though to be due to alcohol withdrawal.

#. Seizure: Felt most likely to be related to EtOH withdrawal.
He also has a history of heavy alcohol use, and alcohol level on
admission consistent with withdrawal. Given his head injury and
focal slowing on EEG, felt to have a significant risk of seizure
recurrence. Got meningitic doses of antibiotics in ED, had
negative LP for meningitis. Neurology followed, recommended
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  Treated with valium CIWA scale.
MRI showed incidental cribiform lipoma but no evidence of acute
stroke or intracranial mass/structural lesions to explain
seizures. PT consulted, recommended patient safe to be
discharged to [**Hospital1 **]. He was set up with neurology follow-up
as outpatient.

# EtOH Withdrawal - pt had large benzo requirements on admission
(>200mg valium) now improving. Valium CIWA scale, treated with
thiamine/folate/MVI. SW/Addictions were consulted, recommended
discharge to [**Hospital1 **] for alcohol rehab, to which patient agreed
(is contemplative about quitting).

# GIB - In ED, reportedly had >600cc bright red NG drainage.
Underwent EGD with clipping of ulcers. Scope also suggestive of
portal gastropathy. HCT stable on floor. Continued oral PPI on
discharge.  Kept active T&S, and adequate PIV access during
admission.

# EtOH Liver Disease - LFTs with AST/ALT ratio > 2 consistent
with alcoholic hepatitis. Discriminant function 23 on admission.
RUQ with portal HTN.
Liver followed. Hepatitis serologies showed borderline hepatitis
B. Mild fevers, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis. Infectious
work-up negative (negative blood, urine cultures, CXR).

# Tongue lesion - needs dental f/u on discharge given risk for
head/neck cancer from alcohol and tobacco abuse.

# Tobacco abuse - smoking cessation

# Hypertension: Added amlodipine.

# Cocaine/Marijuana use - SW consulted. Going to [**Hospital1 **] for
[**Hospital **] rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85 yo woman w/ transfusion dependant
myelofiborisis and diastolic CHF was sent from rehab to ED for
treatment of HCT 21. On arrival in the ED, T 96.3, BP 104/54, HR
95, O2 sat 92% RA-->98% 2L/m. A CXR showed an early RLL
infiltrate and pulmonary edema. She was admitted to Medicine
with a diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, aspiration PNA, and CHF.
She was treated w/ 3L NS, 2units PRBCs, and 40mg lasix IV. The
day after admission, she had temp of 100.0 and was treated with
levoflox 250mg IV and flagyl 500mg IV. UOP was 1600cc overnight.


At 3:45pm the next day, the patient was given lasix 40mg IV. 35
minutes later she was found to have BP 75/39, HR 120, RR 24, and
O2 sat 96% on 2L--> 100% NRB. Temp at that time was 101.8
rectal. She was treated w/ 1L NS, dopamine by PIV, and ceftaz
2gm, and levaquin 500mg. Within the hour, BP increased to 92/34,
HR 110. The MICU team was then consulted for evaluation.  The
patient was transferred to the MICU for treatment of possible
sepsis thought most likely secondary to PNA.  She was treated
with vanocmycin and ceftaz.

The patient was transferred out the floor.  Her antibiotics were
switched to vancoycin and ceftriaxone with a plan to treat for a
10 day course.  She was gently diuresed with lasix 10mg IV QD.
We continued to transfuse for hct<21 and platelets<15.

The patient continued to have increasing amounts of rectal
bleeding thought secondary to internal hemorroids in the setting
of platelets <20.  A GI consult was called.  The patient refused
an exam, but the GI team advised continuing to give platelets
and PRBC.  On [**2131-11-20**], the patient chose to change her code
status from full code to DNR/DNI.  Later that day, the patient
began to have hematuria and [**Date Range **] tingled sputum.  Her breathing
became more labored.  She improved with lasix and morphine, but
continued to become intermittently hypotensive and was again
spiking fevers.  A family meeting with the patient and her son
lead to a decision to make the patient CMO.  All treatments
other than lasix/morphine/and ativan were stopped.  The patient
was started on a morphine drip on [**2131-11-22**] and passed away on
[**2131-11-23**].  The family was notified and refused autopsy.

shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80yo female with multiple medical problems including
hypertension, recent ICU admission with pulmonary edema and
ARDS, and previous admission for septic hip treatment was
admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
.
She has had several recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] within the last 3
months.
- [**Date range (1) 44958**] - She was admitted with a right septic hip and
underwent a washout and repair. She was discharged to complete a
6 week course of nafcillin
- [**Date range (1) 44959**]/09 - She was hospitalized with shortness of breath.
During that admission, she was found to have bilateral
infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia and
superimposed pulmonary edema, as well as diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage. For the pneumonia, she was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics of vancomcyin, zosyn, and azithromycin. For
the pulmonary edema, she was treated aggressively with
diuretics, nitroglycerin, and beta blockers. For the diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage, she was treated for a short time with
steroids complicated by delirium and underwent an extensive
autoimmune work-up which was negative. She was discharged to
rehab with 2L O2 and furosemide 40mg PO bid.
.
While at Rehab, she has developed multiple complications,
including delirium, acute renal failure, fever, chest pain, and
shortness of breath. Her delirium was thought likely related to
medications (received a short course of baclofen), infection,
and renal failure. Regarding her acute renal failure, her
creatinine increased to 2.6 from 1.5 within 2 days after
discharge, her furosemide and anti-hypertensives were
discontinued, and she was started on IVF. Regarding her fever,
she was febrile as high as 102 at the rehab. Regarding her chest
pain and shortness of breath, she was evaluated by a pulmonary
consultant on the day of her transfer and she was thought to be
in a CHF exacerbation.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 100.2, HR 86, BP 133/50, RR 18,
Pulse ox 77% on room air. While in the ED, she remained
afebrile, normotensive, and 96-10% on NRB. She received SL NG x
3 and was then started on a nitro drip for chest pain. She had
blood cultures drawn and received zosyn. She also received zosyn
for pneumonia, was started on a heparin drip for treatment of a
presumed pneumonia, and also given fentanyl 25mcg IV x 1 for
treatment of chest pain.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she initially reported [**7-24**] chest
pain, which she describes as located across her left anterior
chest, character is pleuritic, duration is intermittent,
worsened with deep inspiration or movement, and reliever with
hydromorphone and rest. Additional review of systems is notable
for the following: shortness of breath, fatigue, back pain
(chronic and unchanged), lower extremity swelling, and neck pain
(chronic and unchanged). Her delirium has markedly improved
according to her daughters.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, red
stools. He denies shaking chills, rigors. dysuria, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, cough, sputum production. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

[**2122-3-29**] CXR: There is fluctuating appearance of the parenchymal
opacities consistent with recurrent pulmonary edema. Compared to
the most recent chest radiograph from [**2122-3-28**], there is
interval progression of parenchymal opacities involving the
entire lungs that is worrisome for interval worsening of
pulmonary edema. No appreciable pleural effusions have been
seen, although small amount of pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
No changes in the sternotomy wires position as well as in the
cardiomediastinal contour have been demonstrated. The
fluctuating character of the parenchymal opacities is more
consistent with pulmonary edema than infection, although
underlying foci of infection or ARDS cannot be completely
excluded.
.
[**2122-3-29**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT seen in either
lower extremity.
.
[**2122-3-29**] Renal US : IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis
although the right kidney appears smaller than the left.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 80yo female with history of multiple medical problems
including recent right hip infection, diastolic dysfunction,
recent hospitalization with intubation, and Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus was admitted with shortness of breath.
.
1. Shortness of Breath:
Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure
exacerbation related to her recent medication changes and fluid
administration, pneumonia in the setting of rehab stay / recent
hospitalization / recent intubation, and splinting secondary to
her chest pain. An additional possibility includes pulmonary
embolism given her recent hospitalization and immobilization.
Unfortunately she is not a candidate for a CTA at this time due
to her renal failure, and VQ scan would likely not be helpful
due to her diffuse and patchy infiltrates. She was briefly
started on heparin gtt on admission. Bilateral LENI's were
negative on [**3-29**]. Pulm was consulted and thought CHF most likely
and PE unlikely so heparin gtt was stopped, vanco/zosyn for HAP
were started on [**3-28**] and continued. The pt was diuresed
initially on lasix gtt which was transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] lasix prior
to transfer. At the time of transfer, she continues to c/o
inability to take a deep breath but EKG is without changes and
pt has only slight crackles on exam. Would recommend pt be kept
only slightly negative at OSH as her Cr remains above baseline
at 1.9.
.
2. Chest Pain:
Etiology of her chest pain is unclear. Differential includes
pain related to pneumonia, GERD and esophageal irritation s/p
intubation and NGT placement on prior admission. Pt c/o
odynophagia but has no evidence of aspiration. Pericarditis,
pulmonary embolism, or costochondritis were all considered
unlikely. Her description of her pain is also not consistent
with acute coronary syndrome, and her ECG is also unremarkable
for ACS.  She was treated for HAP as above and given dilaudid
PRN with poor control of her pain at baseline. In future, GI or
ENT could be consulted to evaluate this odynophagia. PPI was
continued here.
.
3. Fever and Leukocytosis
Most likely [**2-16**] pneumonia. At the time of transfer to the OSH,
blood and urine cultures remain without growth and rapid viral
testing was negative. The pt is being continued on vanco/zosyn
for HAP. The pt needs to be on bactrim s/p osteo for 6 months
but this is on hold while pt on vanco/zosyn. This should be
restarted after current abx finished.
.
4. Acute Renal Failure
Etiology of her acute renal failure likely secondary to
dehydration and aggressive diuresis.  Avoided further
nephrotoxins, held ACEI and NSAIDs. In future, would recommend
gentle diuresis.
.
5. Coronary Artery Disease
Continued aspirin and statin. CP not thought c/w ACS. Elevated
trops in setting of unremarkable CK and MB were thought [**2-16**]
renal failure. ECG unchanged.  Beta blocker held in setting of
CHF exacerbation and ACEI held in setting of ARF.
.
6. Anemia
Patient's hematocrit has decreased from 33 at last discharge to
25 here this admission. Hct remained stable until discharge.
Iron studies d/w anemia of chronic disease. Retic count elevated
at 2.4 prior to discharge. Would recommend continuing to trend
Hct and guaiac of stools.
.
7. Hypothyroidism
Stable, continued levothyroxine

CXR [**2137-8-16**]
1. Multifocal opacities with a more confluent opacity in the
right upper lung field. These findings are worrisome for
multifocal pneumonia.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
3. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
.
Echo [**2137-8-16**]
Normal biventricular cavity size with normal regional and low
normal global left ventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. These
findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (OSA,
COPD, etc.).
.
CT Chest [**2137-8-22**]
1. Multifocal pneumonic consolidation predominantly involving
the right upper lobe.
2. Moderate loculated effusion along right minor fissure and
minimal simple effusion bilaterally.
3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Prominent right
hilar
appearance could be due to enlarged lymph node or from enlarged
vessles,
however defining a cause was limited due to lack to intravenous
contrast
administration.
4. Bilateral pleural calcifications. Please correlate with
clinical history for asbestos exposure. If a history is
established, follow-up imaging surveillance is recommended.
.
Dishcarge Chest xray [**2137-8-29**]:
In the interval from the prior examination, an endotracheal tube

has been removed and tracheostomy has been placed in standard
position.
Right-sided PICC is unchanged with tip reaching the low SVC.
There is no
significant change in multifocal opacities, greatest at the
right base. Trace pleural effusions may be present. No
pneumothorax is seen. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with a history of COPD, DMII, CAD and HTN who
was admitted with respiratory failure and multifocal pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: History of COPD, found to be hypoxic at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to 46% on 2L. CXR showed multifocal pneumonia. He
was given levofloxacin in the ED and was intubated. Febrile to
101 rectally in the ED. Failed extubation due to respiratory
fatigue, tachypnea, and worsening shortness of breath. He was
re-intubated and underwent bronchocopy. BAL revealed MRSA. IP
has was consulted for a tracheotomy tube/PEG which were
performed on [**8-27**].  Pt to continue vanco for a total of 14 days
to end [**9-4**]. He may continue to require Oxycodone as needed for
pain related to his tracheostomy tube.

His discharge chest xray showed increased opacities that were
attribute to de-recruitment off the higher ventilator settings.
Would recommend monitoring respiratory status, fever curve
(currently afebrile) and ventilator requirements and would
re-image or consider antibiotics if his clinical status changes.
Plan to wean ventilator as tolerated.
.
# DMII: On oral hypoglycemics at home. On insulin SS in house.
He was started on tube feeds which were at goal at discharge.
Home metformin and glipizide were held-  would restart at time
of discharge to home.
.
# HTN: On diltiazem at home (ER). He was started on lisinopril
which was at 40mg. he initially required IV hydral, which was
transitioned to amlodipine 10mg daily.
.
# CHF/Venous stasis: On furosemide. Chronic venous stasis
changes. EF 50-55% this admission, echo showed pulmonary HTN. He
was diuresed, ultimately put on a standing dose of [**Hospital1 **] Lasix to
remain euvolemic. Lytes were checked and K was replaced
aggressively.  He was on furosemide 40mg daily at discharge.
Would recommend checking [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and replete as
necessary. Goal for diuresis has been 500 cc negative daily
following in/outs.
.
# Glaucoma: Legally blind due to acute angle glaucoma, also with
bilateral cataracts. Continued home eye drops.
.
# Anemia: Unclear baseline. MCV normal. Will monitor. No signs
of bleeding, Hct stable.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **]

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted with pneumonia and required IV antibiotics. These will
be continued at rehab. Due to respiratory distress, you were
intubated and placed on a ventilator (""life support"") until your
lungs fully recovered. You continued to show improvement but
will benefit from a longer weaning from the ventilator, thus a
trachestomy tube was placed. This will be removed when you are
fully able to breathe on your own.

A peg tube (feeding tube through your stomach) was also placed
to facilitate feeding until you are able to eat fully.

You will need to continue the IV antibiotics for another week.

The following changes were made to your medications.
STARTED Albuterol inhaler 6 puffs prn SOB
STARTED acyclovir 400mg Q12
STARTED amlodipine 10mg daily for hypertension
STARTED Docusate sodium for constipation
STARTED Heparin subcutaneous TID
STARTED ipratropium bromide inhaler
STARTED lansoprazole for reflux
STARTED lorazepam for anxiety
STARTED lisinopril for hypertension
STARTED lactulose for constipation
STARTED oxycodone for pain related to your tracheostomy
STARTED Vancomycin (IV antibiotic) for your pneumonia, this will
complete on [**9-4**] for total 14 day course.
STARTED insulin coverage
INCREASED furosemide/lasix dose to 40mg daily
INCREASED citalopram 30mg daily
STOPPED glipizide
STOPPED omeprazole

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF exacerbation: On arrival in the ED, her O2 sats was 75%
on RA, BP 128/78 (which increased to 180/68), 68, and RR 12
(increased to 24). She was placed on BiPap with increase in O2
sat to 91%. CXR indicative of pulmonary edema. Received total of
120 mg IV Lasix with good diuresis, nebs prn, ceftriaxone 1 g
IV. When her BP increased to 180s, she was begun on a nitro gtt
and also received hydralazine 10 mg IV x1. Her bp later dropped
to 80/40, and her nitro was turned off with good BP response.
She was also noted to have non specific lateral ST segment
depression on EKG, with serial negative cardiac enzymes.  Pt
maintained on lasix 80 mg po QD with decent response (~1L net
neg per day).  Did require a few doses of IV lasix 80 mg to
maintain this urine output.  She was also placed on lopressor
and her dose was titrated up to 25mg po TID.  Her heart rate is
in the 60's and she likely has some baseline SA dysfunction
based on her age (i.e. sclerosis), but the further rate control
should help her diastolic filling in addition.  This CHF exac
likely [**3-12**] lingular PNA, pt recieving ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.  Clinda was added
to cover for possible aspiration.  Will d/c for total of 10 day
course of antibiotics.  On the 8th hospital day, her antibiotics
were changed from IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin to PO
levaquin.  The patient now denies SOB, orthopnea or cough.  She
is able to ambulate with help.  She may need 1-2 L O2 by NC at
[**Hospital3 **] to keep her O2 sat betwwen 90-93%.

2.  ST changes: Evaluated by cards in ED. Liekly demand
ischemia, with ST depressions transiently. TTE with no wall
motion abnormalities. Patient was placed on BB for both
decreased myocardial demand and for decreased inotropy and
chronotropy with regard to diastolic dysfunction.  No further
risk stratification was done to the patient since no
intervention would be done in the case of abdnormal result.

3.  DVT: Dx'd [**5-13**].  Pt was supratherapeutic with an INR >8sec
on admission.  Coumadin was held until [**10-29**] when re-institued.
She takes 6mg Tuesdays and Fridays, and 4mg the rest of the
weekdays.  Her coumadin will be managed at [**Hospital3 2558**].  The
coumadin clinic was made aware of this.

4.  Anemia:  Pt is iron deficient.  She will be discharged with
oral ferrous gluconate.  She recieved no blood transfusions.
Her pending iron studies will be followed up by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 665**].

5.  Fall:  The patient fell from a mechanical fall with no LOC.
She had a negative head CT.

6.  Pul Hypertension:  The patient has a chart history of OSA.
She has severe pulmonary arterial hypertension consistent either
with OSA or chronic PE.  She is anticoagulated for prevention of
PE, and our pretest probability for PE while being
anticoagulated is low such that she does not require [**Location (un) **]
placement.  She may need a sleep study to determine if she has
OSA.

History of Present Illness:
31F with h/o Crohn's disease refractory to medical mgmt
(remicade, etc) currently on slow steroid taper. Recently
admitted [**2-25**] with microperforation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] planned on
ileocecectomy on [**5-5**]. The pt now presents with epigastric pain
X 2 weeks in spite of being on cipro, flagyl, prednisone. Flagyl
d/c'd 2 weeks ago and put on prilosec by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**]. Over past
week, pain is worse and in past 24 hrs severe [**6-28**] pain in
epigastrum and RLQ. Pt reports sweating but denies fevers. This
AM, following taking her PO mediacation the pt reported emesis
10-15 times. She also noted [**8-28**] abdominal pain, mostly RLQ,
but also LUQ. Loose stools no melena or BRBPR. Pt reports dry
mouth but denies lighheadedness, dizziness, visual changes or
other presyncopal symptoms.

In ED, 99,4 115/69 120 17 100%RA. While in the ED, Tm 101.4 and
tachy to 130s, normotensive. WBC 5.1 with 15% bandemia, diffuse
peritonitis and rigid abdomen, diffusely tender. CT abd/pelvis
with likely early developing abscess with pockets of free air in
pelvis. The pt received 4L of NS, Dilaudid 1mg IV x7, Morphine
4mg IV, Zofran 4gm IX x1 for pain and tylenol 1gm PO. Abx were
initially continued with Cipro 400mg IV and Flagyl 500mg IV
which was later switched to Vanc 1g IV and Zosyn 4.5mg was
given. An NG tube was placed which the pt states relieved some
of her abdominal bloating.

Pertinent Results:
CT Abdomen (Wet-Read) [**2123-4-26**]
1. Increased size of pelvic collection, Image 2:61, with
multiple tiny pockets of extraluminal air. The collection shows
early signs of organizing to an abscess.
2. Worsening of bowel wall thickening, consistent with Crohn's
flare.
CT Abdomen [**2123-4-28**] (wet read)
Marked interval increase in intraperitoneal fluid tracking
through the
mesentery, around the liver, and collecting in the pelvis. Large
pre-sacral pelvic collection has increased in size and
demonstrates increased rim enhancement, concerning for
developing abscess. Hyperemic mesentery and omental inflammatory
changes, likely worsened since the prior study. Focal collection
previously identified in the mid-pelvis appears largely
unchanged. Redemonstration of bowel wall abnormalities c/w
Crohn's flare, largely stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
31F here with long-standing refractory Crohn's presenting with a
severe flare and intravascular depletion.
.
# Abdominal Pain/Surgical Abdomen: Most likely [**12-21**] Crohn's Flare
given findings on CT (Multiple Tiny Pockets of Extraluminal Air,
Worsening bowel wall thickening consistent with Crohns flare).
Other less likely etiologies include perforated ulcer (given
chronic steroid use). Evaluated by surgery in ED and upon
admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Received IV vancomycin/zosyn. Per GI to
continue hydrcortisone 100 mg qdaily. NGT placed. Foley in
place. Strict NPO, serial abd exam.
- NPO
- Serial Abdominal Exam
-Antibiotics
-Hydrocortisone 100mg Daily
- Morphine 2-4mg IV PRN Abdominal Pain
.
# Sinus Tachycardia: In the setting of intravascular depletion,
crohns flare, abdominal pain.
- IVF resuscitation
- Pain Control with Morphine 2-4mg IV PRN
- Broad Spectrum ABx

.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 she was made NPO with
IVF/Foley/IVMeds/ABX. She was febrile to 102.9 with increased
pain. Her pain medication  was changed from morphine to dilaudid
with good effect. The patient also had a repeat CT scan showing
a fluid collection in her abdomen. She was taken to IR to have a
drain place. Scant thick pus aspirated and cultured.
.
A PICC line was placed and the patient was started on TPN with
bowel rest. She continued to spike temps to 103.0. Multiple
fever workups were done including BCX, UCX and CXR all negative
for infection. She had multiple CT scans done indicating
abcesses. She was taken to IR for Drain placement, 2 drains
placed for a total of 4 drains.
.
Despite the drain placements the patient continued to spike
temps to 104.6 on HD 19 requiring a cooling blanket. She was
than pre-op'd and taken to the OR for ex-lap, washout and drain
placement.
.
She returned to the floor. She was maintained as NPO, TPN was
continued along with a PCA, IVF, ABX. Infectious disease was
also consulted to recommend treatment. POD 1 the patient was
afebrile. However she continued to spike daily fevers there on
out. ID continued to follow the patient adjust antibiotics as
needed.
.
The patient c/o of severe pain and the pain service was
consulted. She was started on a fentynal patch and PO dilaudid
with good effect. At discharge the patient no longer needed the
fentynal patch, her pain was well controlled with dilaudid. Her
TPN was cycled and with the return of bowel function and flatus
her diet was advanced from sips to regular. Her TPN was d/c'd
once she tolerated regular diet.
All of her drains were d/c'd prior to d/c. The patient was
encouraged to have ensure with all meals. All D/C paperwork was
reviewed with the patient and all questions answered. She will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in [**11-20**] weeks.

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old right
handed woman with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease, hypertension, history of aneurysm clip seven years
ago at [**Hospital6 1129**], who at 4:00 p.m. on
the day of admission had sudden onset vertigo, right facial
weakness, and dysarthria. The week prior she had had one
minute episodes of a ""dizzy"" sensation while she was sitting
and watching television and noted some heaviness in the left
leg only.  Transport services [**Location (un) **] reported that the
patient had had headache in the right temporal region, now
resolved per the patient.  Systolic blood pressure was in the
160s on arrival, heart rate in the 80s, and she is in sinus
rhythm.  Temperature at the outside hospital was 96.1.
AccuChek was 143.  Daughter-in-law and son report very severe
right facial droop and dysarthria that is very difficult to
understand her.  It improved in the Emergency Department at
the outside hospital, but she is not still at baseline.  The
patient also reports ""dizziness"".

5.  Depression after brain aneurysm.
6.  Gastrointestinal, loose stools, dark stools, incontinence
of urine and feces with coughing.
7.  Family also reports anemia.
8.  Suspect gastrointestinal problems but she has not been
scoped.  There are no liver, kidney, cancer history and no
history of diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Fracture of the arm, status post pin in [**2148-2-1**],
pins out three days prior to admission.

respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 92% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - sclera clear.
Mucous membranes are moist although dry around the mouth.
Neck - no bruits.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm.
Chest - Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
The abdomen is obese, soft.  Extremities no edema
bilaterally.  Neurologic examination - mental status - alert
and oriented.  There is dysarthria although she follows
commands and speech is fluent.  Extraocular movements are
impaired.  Upgaze, right more than left.  She looks to the
right and left.  Right eye did not look laterally.  Adduction
impaired.  Right pupil 4.0 millimeters, left pupil is 6.0
millimeters.  Ptosis in the right eye, torsional upbeating
nystagmus in primary gaze.  Right facial weakness.  Head
turning intact bilaterally.  Shoulder shrug intact
bilaterally.  Decreased sensation in right V1 through V3.
There is tongue midline but slightly deviated to the left.
Hearing is intact bilaterally to finger rub.  Over the course
of hospitalization, the nystagmus has improved significantly
as well as the facial droop although she does continue to
have somewhat of a facial droop.  Motor - bilateral grasp is
[**6-5**].  Biceps [**6-5**].  Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius [**6-5**].
The patient did continue to have full strength throughout.
Sensation intact bilaterally to light touch throughout.
Coordination - fine finger movements intact bilaterally in
hands.  She moves very ataxic on initial examination,
however, this improved significantly and she has much less
ataxia on [**2148-6-3**].  Reflexes are symmetric.  Both toes are
upgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2148-6-3**], white blood count 10.3,
hematocrit 30.7, and she was transfused throughout the
hospital course to attempt to keep the hematocrit above 30.0.
However, stool guaiac was negative.  Platelet count was
269,000.  INR on [**2148-6-3**], was 1.4.  Partial thromboplastin
time was 63.8.  Prothrombin time was 14.5.  Fibrinogen was
294.  Reticulocyte count 1.9.  Protein B 121 which is normal.
Urinalysis on [**2148-5-28**], was positive.  Repeat urinalysis
after treatment on [**2148-6-3**], is now negative.  Glucose 120,
blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.7, sodium 140, potassium
4.4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27 on [**2148-6-3**].  ALT 19, AST
15, LDH 154, alkaline phosphatase 58, amylase 11, total
bilirubin 0.5.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction by
enzymes twice.  Lipase 17.  Calcium 8.9, phosphate 4.3,
magnesium 2.4.  Iron 34, total cholesterol 178, TIBC 224,
Vitamin B12 315, folate 12.7, haptoglobin 238, ferritin 41,
transferrin 172.  Hemoglobin A1C 6.1.  Triglycerides 103, HDL
54, LDL 103, homocysteine 5.9.  TSH 0.77.  Urine culture was
growing Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterococcus species, both of
which are pansensitive.  Sputum culture was no growth.
Factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] is pending.  Protein S 68 which is within
normal range.  Angiocardiolipin antibodies IgG and IgM normal
at 3.0 and 3.1, respectively.  Lipoprotein A is high at 60 on
[**2148-5-24**].

Initial magnetic resonance scan of the head showed bilateral
pica infarcts, also an aneurysm clip causing loss of signal,
inability to evaluate in distal right internal carotid artery
M1 and A1 segments.  Angiogram on [**2148-5-23**], showed multiple
areas of thrombosis including right vertebral artery
thrombosis, left pica thrombosis, stenosis at the origin of
the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery as well as
stenosis of the left vertebral artery in both its proximal
segment above the level of C5 vertebral body as well as the
level of C1 vertebral body, approximately 50%, as well as
distal intracranial left vertebral artery stenosis greater
than 60% but with a patent basilar artery and collateral flow
as described in the results.  Serial head CT proved stable.
There is hypoattenuation in the cerebellar cortex consistent
with pica infarction bilaterally.  There is some surrounding
edema, however, no midline shift or evidence of tonsillar
herniation.  There was some distortion of the fourth
ventricle and flattening of the quadrigeminal plate cistern
which was unchanged as well as a hypodensity in the left
basal ganglia consistent with an old infarct.  There was
never any herniation or change in the CT.  CT of the abdomen
and pelvis on [**2148-6-1**], showed no evidence of retroperitoneal
hemorrhage.  This was obtained because of the patient's
hematocrit, however, there was no retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
There was bilateral mild to moderate atelectasis in the
lungs.  There was no free air and no lymphadenopathy.  There
was a large left sided paraesophageal hernia.  This hernia
required placement of nasogastric tube with the help of
interventional radiology initially.

Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of
40%, left and right atrium normal in size, left ventricular
wall thickness normal with mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction.  There is a moderate size thrombus in
the left ventricle.  Left ventricular wall motion
abnormalities show at the anterior apex akinetic, septal apex
akinetic, lateral apex akinetic and the apex akinetic.  Right
ventricle and right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion normal.  Aortic root normal in diameter.  Aortic valve
leaflets mildly thickened, no aortic regurgitation.  Mitral
valve showed trivial mitral regurgitation seen.  There is no
pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, initially
transferred, and underwent angiogram revealing occluded right
vertebral artery and stenosis in the left vertebral artery in
addition to her pica infarcts bilaterally.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram showed incidental clot in the heart although
the infarcts were thought to be due to artery-artery emboli
from the vertebrals.  Hypercoagulable workup was originally
sent because initially the clot in the heart was found,
though likely this clot formed because of the akinetic apex.
The hypercoagulable workup revealed elevated lipoprotein A.
This will be repeated this week and will be treated with
Niacin should it still be high.  The patient was started on
Heparin on the day of admission especially given this clot in
the heart and she was continued on Labetalol drip to control
her blood pressure to keep it in the systolic range of 120 to
160.

On [**2148-5-26**], the day after admission, the patient was
transiently transferred to the floor, however, she became
agitated.  She self discontinued her femoral line which was
her only access and later had some episode of desaturating to
the mid 80s.  The repeat head CT showed signs of cerebellar
edema, but no herniation.  She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit.  She did remain stable in the Intensive
Care Unit and was started on Coumadin initially, however, was
requiring frequent suctioning for her sputum.  Feeding tube
was placed and she was started on tube feeds.   She did
become somnolent around the date of [**2148-5-29**], however, she
was found at that time to have a urinary tract infection and
was started on Levaquin.  On [**2148-6-3**], was day six of the
Levaquin.

The patient was transfused for her anemia. Anemia workup was
sent and her stool guaiac was negative. Later on that
evening, she desaturated while being suctioned.  She had
transient respiratory arrest and became very bradycardic.
Code Blue was called.  Chest compressions were given for
about one minute when the patient became asystolic and the
patient was intubated.

At the time of the code, the patient was at her baseline
neurologic status and then after intubation she was moving
all four extremities.  Head CT at that time was unchanged.
Heparin drip was temporarily stopped and a central line was
placed.  The patient was placed on Propofol at that time.
The following day the patient was taken off the Propofol and
she did awaken and was able to follow commands well.  She was
intubated for the next couple of days for stabilization of
her respiratory status and was extubated on [**2148-6-1**], and did
well after that.  By [**2148-6-3**], the frequency of suctioning
decreased and the patient was on nasal cannula.

Her issues neurologically, the patient suffered bilateral
pica strokes.  She is on Lipitor for future stroke prevention
and also continues on Heparin drip until she has a
therapeutic INR on her Coumadin.  As for the elevated
lipoprotein A, that will be repeated and then Niacin will be
started if it does indeed remain elevated.

Respiratory wise, she has been extubated and is stable,
status post extubation.   It is unclear as to whether some of
her somnolence may have been due to CO2 narcosis and so today
she has been maintaining oxygen saturation in the low to mid
90s and has become more awake, is doing well on oxygen by
nasal cannula.

Cardiovascularly, she is now on Metoprolol, Enalapril and
p.r.n. Hydralazine for her blood pressure and is off the
Labetalol drip.

Gastrointestinal - She has a large hiatal hernia and
nasogastric tubes are very difficult to place.  She will
receive a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube tomorrow
[**2148-6-4**], as she cannot swallow, has failed her swallowing
evaluation and likely will not be able to swallow for some
time.

Infectious disease - She ahs remained afebrile throughout her
hospital course.  She was found to have a urinary tract
infection on [**2148-5-29**], and is now on day six of the Levaquin.
This will likely be continued for seven days and stopped.

Hematologically, her hematocrit remained stable.  Currently
she is being transfused for hematocrit less than 30.0.  She
has not had any retroperitoneal bleed and no guaiac positive
stools.

Renally, she is stable and there are no issues.

Endocrine wise, she does have evidence of diabetes mellitus
with a hemoglobin A1C of 6.0.  She is on four times a day
fingerstick and her regular insulin sliding scale.  She will
need outpatient follow-up for this.

Code Status - Her code status has been full code.

She has improved as far as having no further double vision,
less vertigo and less dysarthria at this point than on
admission.  She is being currently stabilized for transfer to
the floor at some point in the very near future.

The oncoming [**Male First Name (un) 1573**] resident will dictate the rest of the
hospital course, discharge instructions, medications and
follow-up.

REPORT TITLE:  Death Summary.

SERVICE:  Neurology.

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Vertigo.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old woman with
a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, who
was admitted on [**2148-5-24**] with sudden onset of vertigo,
right facial weakness and dysarthria.  She did have a
headache and she endorsed vomiting as well.  She arrived at a
local hospital initially and then was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

Of note, the week prior to admission she apparently had one
minute episodes of dizziness while watching TV as well as
some left leg heaviness.  She did have pins out of her left
arm recently for recent arm fracture, and stopped aspirin for
some period of time, only restarting it on the Monday prior
to this admission.  She was admitted to the ICU here, and
thought to have nystagmus, right Horner's syndrome, and right-
sided facial weakness and numbness.  An angiogram in the ICU
revealed open basilar artery, bilateral vertebral artery
disease, and extracranial right internal carotid artery
stenosis.  She was treated with Heparin drip and required
some labetalol drip to control hypertension.

Her ICU course here was complicated by hypoxia and
tachycardia and possible atelectasis.  She also did develop a
pansensitive Klebsiella and Enterococcal UTI.  Swallowing was
greatly compromised, and a feeding tube had been planned.  An
echocardiogram did show left ventricular thrombus with poor
systolic function due to prior history of CHF.  On [**5-29**], the patient desaturated and had apnea and asystole
likely due to inability to tolerate her secretions due to
swallow dysfunction.  She was intubated and eventually was
extubated on [**6-2**], but still required some suctioning
care.  She was transferred to the floor on [**2148-6-4**] and
still had a cough and copious secretions.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HABITS:  Smoking history, but quit in [**2146**].  There is no
alcohol or drug abuse history.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She currently lives with a roommate and has
a visiting nurse.  Her son lives nearby.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had a MI, and father had MI at age
50.  There is also a family history of aneurysm.

EXAM UPON TRANSFER:  Temperature 98.8, blood pressure 138/84,
heart rate 96, respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation 97
percent on 2 liters.  In general, she was an obese woman
coughing in bed.  HEENT exam reveals moist mucous membranes.
Lungs revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular, rate, and rhythm
without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  There were no carotid
bruits.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Extremities showed
no pedal edema or rashes.  Mental status:  Patient was
inattentive and oriented to [**Hospital1 188**], [**2148-5-2**].  Her language is fluent and was intact to
naming, repetition, and comprehension.  There was a mild
anosognosia.  There was no left-right agnosia.  Cranial
nerves:  The visual fields were somewhat suggestive of a left
field cut versus left inattention, but this was inconsistent.
Eye movements were remarkable for lateral abduction failure
bilaterally.  Pupils were reacting normally to light.
Sensation on the face was intact to light touch and pin.
There was a right facial droop.  Hearing is intact to finger
rub.  There is no nystagmus.  The tongue and palate are
midline.  The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles are
strong bilaterally.  There was a cough and a gag reflex.
Motor:  There was a subtle question left hemiparesis of the
arms more proximal than distal.  There was a lot of motor
impersistence, but the lower extremities have full strength
and symmetric.  There were no adventitious movements.
Sensation appeared intact to light touch, pin, and joint
position in the extremities and the trunk.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, as mentioned, was initially
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and then transferred to
the floor.  She had previously been on the Neurology floor
briefly for a day before she had difficulty with her
secretions.  At this time while on the floor, she continued
to have coughing and was able to cough up her secretions, but
still needed Yankauer suctioning.  She maintained good
oxygenation on nasal cannula, and she appeared to do well
until [**2148-6-8**] when early on the 8th, she had an episode
of hypoxia, cyanosis with difficulty breathing.  She was
thought to either potentially be not tolerating her
secretions versus cardiac heart failure.  A chest x-ray was
performed, which showed some mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and Lasix IV was given to try to alleviate this.
In addition, she was suctioned with Yankauer, and some
secretions came up.  The patient did resolve somewhat after
this.  But a few hours later that morning, she had another
event, which resulted in hypoxia and cyanosis in the face.

At this time, deep nasotracheal suctioning was helpful and
did bring up a lot of mucus secretions.  The respiratory
therapist did note that she had a lot of swelling and
difficulty obtaining secretions by suctioning was considered
to be due to some of the swelling in the trachea.

She was transferred to the Neurologic ICU for closer
respiratory care.  The situation was discussed with her son,
who felt that the patient had clearly stated to the family
that the patient would not want resuscitation or intubation
should her clinical condition worsen.  In addition, he also
reiterated at that time that she would not want a permanent
feeding tube.

A CAT scan was done to ensure that there was no other cause
for clinical deterioration besides aspiration, and
incidentally bilateral occipital strokes were revealed on CAT
scan that seemed to be evolving posterior circulation
infarct.

The family was informed of these findings, and given that she
had more strokes, the family felt that she would not want to
continue on in this way, and made her comfort measures only.
She had all medications discontinued except for comfort
medications in the ICU, and she expired at about 01:55 on [**2148-6-8**].

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old man with history of CAD, left ventriuclar systolic
dysfunction with EF 20-25%, type II diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, anemia, history of v-tach, chronic renal
insufficiency admitted with worsening renal failure, metabolic
acidosis, undocumented fevers, and concern for UTI or pneumonia.
 During his hospitalization the following problems were
addressed:

1.  Worsening renal failure: the patient's baseline creatinine
was 2.2-2.4, and he presented with creatinine of 3.2.
Previously he had been discharged to rehab on n lisinopril and
lasix, and his creatinine worsened since that time.  Renal
failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac
function, prerenal azotemia leading to ATN, and complicated by
ACE inbitor and lasix use, obstruction due to prostatic
hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of 350cc
when catheter was inserted, and continued periods of
hypotension.  Renal service consulted.  Despite efforts to
closely monitor his fluid status, to increase his blood pressure
to SBP >120 to maintain renal perfusion, to relieve obstruction
by placing a foley, and to treat his funguria aggressively, his
creatinine continued to rise.  Hemodialysis was discussed at
length with the patient by both the primary medical and renal
teams.  He fluctuated in his willingness to start dialysis, but
would not commit to it.  He developed subtle metabolic acidosis,
K+ rose but not above the normal level, and he continued to make
urine and maintain a euvolemic fluid balance.  There was no an
indication for acute initiation of hemodialysis.  Creatinine
stabilized at around 4.2 by the time of discharge.

2.  Funguria: the patient had a fever and a delirium.  The only
source of infection identified was yeast in his urine, and it
was felt this warrented treatment.  Two species of yeast were
identified; [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans and galabrate.  He was treated with
a two week course of fluconazole 200mg daily.  Infectious
disease service was consulted and saw no indication for
amphotericin bladder washes.  They recommended continuing the
two week course of fluconazole.

3.  Conjestive heart failure:  With treatment for his renal
failure the patient developed acute worsening of his conjestive
heart failure.  He became hypoxic and was admitted to the CCU.
There a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for tailored diuresis.  He
was diuresed and placed on afterload reduction with hydralazine.
 He was transferred back to the floor on metoprolol,
hydralazine, and lasix.  His renal failure continued to worsen
on this regimen, and he became hypotensive with SBP 80-90.  The
metoprolol dose was reduced, the hydralazine initially held,
then restarted at a reduced dose, and lasix discontinued.  His
respiratory status remained stable.  He did not complain of
shortness of breath.  He continued to saturate well on room air.
 He did have elevated JVP suggestive of fluid overload.  This
improved but did not resolve entirely by the time of discharge.
He was discharged on continued metoprolol, hydralazine, and
statin, for secondary prevention of CHF exacerbation.

4.  Fevers:  The patient presented initially with fevers, with
concern for UTI and pneumonia.  CXR here showed a possible
pneumonia, and he was treated with levofloxacin.  Additionally
he was treated with flagyl for c.diff infection.  He completed
both courses.  He also ruled out for influenza by nasal
aspirate.  Additionally, there was concern for osteomyelitis
given his chronic left heal ulcer.  X-ray; however, did not show
any signs of osteomyelitis.

5.  h/o DVT:  pt had a DVT diagnosed in [**12-26**].  He was continued
on anticoagulation. INR became surpratherapeutic while on
concurrent antibiotics, and coumadin was held.  It remained
elevated, thought to be due to nutritional Vit K deficiency, but
eventually trended down.  He should be treated for an additional
3months.  Coumadin should be resumed at 2mg qHS, and held for
INR >2 (goal INR [**1-24**]).

6.  Anemia:  the patient has a history of anemia and guiaic
positive stools.  He continued to have guiaic positive stools,
but his Hct remained stable.  He had a colonoscopy in [**12-26**] that
showed benign adenomatous polyps.  He should likely consider
repeat colonoscopy as part of his outpatient.  He was treated
with Epogen injections, and Hct remained stable.

7.  Type II diabetes mellitus:  [**Last Name (un) **] services were consulted.
The patient was initially treated with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  He was then on tubefeeds for about three weeks, and
lantus was added.  When the tubefeeds were discontinued, hte
lantus dose was reduced.  He was discharged to rehab on 26units
Lantus in the mornings, and a regular insulin sliding scale.

8.  Dispo:  he was discharged back to [**Hospital3 **].  His
renal failure may progress, and he may require hemodialysis at
some time in the future.  For now, he continues to be euvolemic
and stable.  He should be encouraged to improve his po diet to
sustain nutrition for healing of his pressure ulcers.  He will
follow up with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the primary care clinic, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in nephrology, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in cardiology.

Chief Complaint:  respiratory failure and altered mental status

Reason for MICU transfer:  intubated

History of Present Illness: 63 yo F (real name [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 11135**])
with PMHx of alcohol abuse with withdrawal seizures, a SDH s/p R
craniotomy, HTN and HL who presents intubated from [**Hospital1 2519**] for confusion.

Per OSH records, patient fell the night prior to arrival on
cousin's floor and struck her head; denied LOC, but c/o left
brow pain, heaache,  chipped tooth and sore R shoulder.  A
preliminary head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality
with chronic findings (old R parietal craniotomy, old R burr
hole).  Labs were notable for lactate 1.2, normal chem 7, normal
CBC, normal UA, ammonia 32 (WNL). Tox negative for ethanol,
salicylates, acetominophen.  The patient was intubated for
failure to oxygenate/ventilate and inability to protect airway
(sedation and confusion). CXR showed R mainstem intubation-->
pulled back 1 cm and improved L lung aeration.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.7, 91, 137/78, 21, 99%.  Labs
notable for UA with small WBC, Pos nitrite, few bact.  ABG
7.33/41/421 on 450/100%.  Initially in the ED, she was ""fighting
the vent"" and was making purposeful movements of all 4
extremities to attempt to remove the ETT, she was then heavily
sedated in the ED with fentanyl and midazolam.  She received
500mg azithromycin and 1g of ceftriaxone.  Neurology was
consulted who recommended EEG.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  94.5, 73, 97/64. Patient
was intubated and sedated.  Vent 450/12/40%/5.

MICRO

IMAGING
CXR 8.20
A feeding tube is noted with tip at the level of the gastric
antrum.  ET tube is at the carina and should be repositioned.
Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of
bronchovascular markings.  Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by
low lung volumes.  Additionally, opacification at the left lung
base and in the retrocardiac region appears concerning for
either pleural effusion versus atelectasis, infectious process
such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct
clinical setting.

CXR 8.21
In comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there again are lower lung

volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal or
slightly
enlarged.  Minimal poor definition of pulmonary vessels could
reflect slight
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Blunting of
costophrenic angles could
reflect small effusions or pleural thickening.

No definite pneumonia is appreciated, though in the appropriate
clinical
setting a supervening consolidation would be difficult to
exclude in lower
zones.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo F with PMH alcohol abuse with seizures, SDH s/p burr hole
5 years ago admitted with acute change in mental status.

# Acute Respiratory Failure:  Patient arrived to the ICU
intubated for respiratory failure in settting of acute
confusional state.  The patient's initial ABG was reassuring and
she was deemed able to extubate.  She was extubated on the day
of arrival to the ICU and tolerated it well.  Her oxygen
saturation remained in the mid to high 90s on room air.  The
etiology of her respiratory was felt to be her toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy as noted below.

# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy:  The patient presented with
acute altered mental status with history of alcohol abuse and
seizures, also with history of SDH s/p craniotomy 5 years ago.
The etiology was unclear, but the differential included alcohol
withdrawal/seizure, toxic metabolic (hepatic encephalopathy),
CVA/ICH, sepsis, wernicke's encephalopathy.  UA unremarkable.
Ammonia level normal.  Lactic acid WNL.  Drug induced possible,
home medications were difficult to clarify (the patient and her
family were poor historians).  The patient showed no signs of
alcohol withdrawl and required only one dose of diazepam on the
CIWA protocol, which was mostly given for insomnia.  She was
given thiamine.  Neurology was consulted and they performed an
EEG, which showed no epileptiform activity.  The day of
discharge, she developed a headache, but a repeat head CT was
normal, and she felt better after Tylenol and ibuprofen so was
discharged to follow-up as an outpatient.

# Chronic cough: the pt had a non-productive cough during your
admission, which has been present for several years, according
to the patient.  She had no fevers, chills, oxygen requirement
or leukocytosis, so she was not treated for a pneumonia, and she
felt this was at her baseline.  I suspect she may have COPD due
to second hand smoke exposure (ex-husband smoked for 25 years
with her).  She should have outpatient PFTs done to further
evaluate this.

# Coordination of care: I attempted to speak with the patient's
PCP and Neurologist, but neither were available by phone on the
day of discharge.  They will be sent a copy of this summary.

# Inactive issues: The patient was continued on her home
amitriptyline, fluoxetine, furosemide, gabapentin, topiramate,
and methocarbamol.

Discharge Instructions:
You developed confusion at home, fell and struck your head,
suffering a headache, chipped tooth and sore R shoulder. You
became progressively more confused until you were taken to
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Hospital1 **] where your evaluation included a head CT, which was
unchanged from your prior (not normal due to your history of
subdural hemorrhage ~5 yrs ago with old R parietal craniotomy,
old R burr hole). Lab testing was unremarkable.  You were
intubated (placed on a breathing machine) because your mental
status was so poor and you could not protect your airway and you
were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**]. Here you were quickly
extubated (taken off the breathing machine) and you
spontaneously improved. The Neurology consult team saw you and
could not explain what had happened.  You developed a headache
on the day of discharge, but a repeat head CT was normal, and
you felt better after Tylenol and ibuprofen so were discharged
to follow-up as an outpatient.

Followup Instructions:
Primary Care
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor within the next
few weeks.  Dr. [**Last Name (un) **] (your [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] discharging
physician) called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1437**], but he was unavailable.  After
reviewing your discharge summary, his office will call you with

Chief Complaint:
Heavy menses, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
43 year old woman with history of dm2 (diagnosed [**1-14**]), seizure
disorder and prior heavy menses is presenting for evaluation
after she started to feel weak and tired since her last
menstrual period.  Flow ended ~1 week ago after ~8 days of heavy
flow. She was evaluated by her PCP who saw that her Hct was
lower than her previously mildly low baseline.  She noted that
she's lost 4 pounds over the past week as well as frequent
nocturia and frequently drinking water. She presented for
concern that her fatigued state was not prepared to go through
another heavy menstrual bleeding cycle and as her PCP was
retired she needed additional medical care.

Upon arrival to the ED, her initial vitals signs were 99.1F 76
148/71  18  100%RA.  A serum blood sugar was 356 with AG of 20.
She received 2 L of NS and was placed on an insulin gtt
following an IV bolus of 10 units.  Her glucose trended down and
her insulin gtt was transiently stopped although her AG had not
closed.  She was started on dextrose containing fluids and had
the insulin gtt resumed and admitted to the ICU.  She received
40 mEq of KCl PO.

ROS: no HA, no fevers/chills/sweats, no dysuria, no cough, no
bowel symptoms. no SOB, no CP.


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old woman with hx of DM2, seizure d/o, anemia thought
secondary to heavy menstrual bleeding who presented to the ED
with fatigue and was found to be in DKA.  She was admitted to
the MICU for further eval.

1) DKA ?????? In the MICU the patient was kept on an insulin drip
until her anion gap closed and she could be transitioned to long
acting insulin injections instead. She was given IV fluids and
her electrolytes were repleted as necessary. The instigating
event was found to be medication non-compliance. The patient
admitted to not taking her Metformin and Glyburide due to a
previous HgA1c [**Location (un) 1131**] of <7. While in the MICU she eventually
tolerated a diabetic diet and remained without an anion gap for
24hours on only injectable insulin before she was transferred to
the floor. On the floor she continued to have no anion gap,
tolerate her diet, and remain symptom free. She was taught how
to use the insulin syringes and was discharged on glargine and
humalog insulin at the same doses she had been receiving in the
hospital. She will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center for
further management of her diabetes and they will follow up the
lab test drawn to ascertain which type of diabetes she has,
including C peptide, GAD, anti Insulin Ab, Anti Islet Ab.

2) Anemia - likely secondary to menstrual bleeding.
Microcytosis, iron studies and expanding RDW overtime suggested
iron deficiency as cause. During her hospitalization, no
signs/symptoms of active bleeding.  Gave iron supplementation,
along with a bowel regimen.  Per the pt, she has not had the
anemia worked up in the past with colonoscopy or other GU
studies (such as transvag ultrasound).  Will require close
follow up- has appt with new Gyn as well as with a new PCP who
will order these tests for her and keep watch on her blood
counts.

3) Seizure d/o - no active issues.  Continued home regimen of
lamictal.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Iron deficiency anemia
leukopenia - improved


Discharge Condition:
Patient was hemodynamically stable, with no anion gap,  and
symptom free for 24hours pre-discharge.


Discharge Instructions:
You were diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis which was caused
most likely by a viral infection. You will need to take insulin
at home once daily but also check your sugars four times a day.
You will need to be followed up closely at the [**Hospital **] clinic for
this.

If you develop nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, excessive
urination, or other worrisome symptoms you should call your
primary care doctor or come to the emergency room.

You were also found to be anemic with low blood counts. You did
not require a transfusion for this and it was likely because of
heavy periods. You should follow up with your primary care
doctor for this.

You also had low WBC.  Please recheck this with your PCP and
discuss with him regarding need for further workup.

If you develop severe fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath,
chest pain, or very heavy bleeding you should call your doctor
or come to the emergency department.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your new primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
Heparin was begun after admission and on [**2-10**] she went to the
Operating Room where surgery was performed. See operative note
for details.  She weaned from bypass on NeoSynephrine and
Propofol infusions.  She remained stable, was awakened and
extubated the evening of surgery and came off pressor quickly.
She then was hypertensive, requiring Nitroglycerin intravenously
for control. She was diuresed and was weak and confused.

She remained in the ICU for several days, transferring to the
floor on [**2-16**]. She had a very poor appetite, as at home according
to family and was very slow to participate in her care (also as
at home).  A feeding tube remained in (stoach ) and tube feeding
were given. Speech and swallow studiesd were done several times
and she was advance to a ground solids/nectar thick liquid diet
with crushed pills in puree.

She had urinary retension and the Foley was replaced on [**2-19**] for
700cc. Hopefully as she becomes mobile this will resolve. She
was changed to nocturnal tube feeds(1900-0400) with full
strength Glucerna 1.0 at 55cc/hour. This was in a effort to get
her to eat during the day.  She requires much encouragement and
prompting to eat, use the incentive spirometer and help with her
care.

Coumadin was resumed for her chronic atrial fibrillation, with a
target INR of [**1-15**].5.

She was discharged to [**Hospital3 7665**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 3597**], NH for
further recovery on [**2-19**].  All follow up appointments were given.

IMPRESSION:

1. Morphology of the liver is consistent with cirrhosis. Of
note, there is
partial clot within the main and right portal veins, with flow,
therefore this is non-occlusive. This does, however had the
appearance of recanalization. Additionally, there is no flow
within the posterior branch of the right portalvein which is
completely occluded with echogenic clot. The flow within the
main portal vein, left portal vein and anterior branch of the
right portalvein is hepatopetal.

2. Trace ascites, varices and splenomegaly, findings consistent
with portal
hypertension.

3. Hypodense lesion within the periphery of the spleen may
represent an
infarct, especially in the setting of clot within the portal
venous system.
However, other diagnostic considerations include a focal
hematoma in the
appropriate clinical setting of trauma. Of note, there is no
flow within thesplenic lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 yo woman with cirrhosis secondary to PBC and
autoimmune hepatitis who presented from home after routine labs
showed INR of 5.3. INR was 7.0 on admission. It did decrease
some with IV vitamin K. During her admission, a liver donor
became available and she accepted the donor liver offer. On
[**2193-3-15**], she underwent liver [**Date Range **] with aortic conduit.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Induction immunosuppression was given
(solumedrol and cellept). Please refer to operative notes for
further details. She was sent to the SICU immediately postop for
care. LFTs increased immediately postop, but trended down each
day. A liver duplex demonstrated patent vessels. Medial and
lateral JPs were non-bilious. She was extubated o [**3-16**] and
transferred out of the SICU after 3 days on [**3-17**].

Diet was slowly advanced and she was able to take in 1600
kcals/58 grams protein. She was assisted to get oob to ambulate
wearing her TLSO brace for known thoracic and lumbar compression
fractures. The medial JP was removed on [**3-20**] with a daily output
of 130cc. The lateral JP output remained high  (1500 cc) and
serum sodium was low (down to 126)requiring IV saline fluid
replacements and albumin. This continued for several more days.
Serum sodium normalized and JP output decreased to 500cc/day by
postop day 12 ([**3-27**]). At this point, the lateral jp was removed
and site sutured. This site as well as the incision remained
dry.

She did well with medication teaching and insulin sliding scale
injection (due to hyperglycemia from steroids). An interpreter
was present for these sessions. Immunosuppression consisted of
cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 **] that was well tolerated. Steroids were
tapered to 20mg daily and prograf was adjusted by trough levels.
Discharge dose was 3mg [**Hospital1 **].

She was discharged with low dose lasix daily for 2 + lower leg
edema to knees. VNA services were arranged for nursing, PT and
evaluation of home health services.

Discharge Diagnosis:
pneumonia, presumed PCP

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
fever and fatigue.  You were found to have pneumonia, likely due
to an infection from pneumocystis (PCP).  You developed
difficulty  breathing requiring a stay in the ICU from [**11-23**] to
[**11-26**].  Your breathing improved as you were treated for PCP with
antibiotics and steroids. You should discuss with your
oncologist whether or not you should continue with your steroids
after you finish the prednisone and if you continue with the
prednisone or dexamethasone you should take bactrim prophylaxis
for PCP which is usually one tablet three times per week.

Please make the following changes to your medications:
START Bactrim DS 2 tabs three times daily for a total of 21 days
until [**12-14**]
START Prednisone 40 mg daily until [**12-3**], then 20 mg daily until
[**12-14**]
STOP Dexamethasone

Please STOP your current pain regimen of morphine and dilaudid.
Please START the following regimen:
MS Contin 45 mg twice a day (take one 30 mg tablet and one 15 mg
tablet for a total of 45 mg)
Dilaudid 2 mg every 4-6 hrs as needed for pain.

Addendum:
**Seizure**
.
Pt had seizure when IV was being pulled out for discharge [**11-30**].
 Husband witnessed event and said patient became rigid with eyes
deviated up.  Pt breathing with pulse.  Self-resolved without IM
ativan. Lasted approximately 1 minute.  No prior history of
seizure.
.
STAT CT head was obtained and showed no acute process or brain
metastases (other than known mets to parietal bone).  Neurology
was consulted.  MRI head was obtained to further assess for
intracranial process with negative wet read.  Electrolytes were
obtained and revealed Na 123 post-seizure although recheck in AM
was 131.
.
Discussed electrolyte changes with neurology who believe the
drop in Na is unlikely to be related to seizure.  Unusual for Na
to drop and increase so rapidly leading to question of erroneous
lab error.  Urine lytes showed osm 683 and Na 71.  SIADH may be
possible although patient seemed hypovolemic on exam and was
given IVF overnight.  She was free water restricted while
encouraging intake of gatorade, ensure, etc.
.
Per neurology recommendations, an LP was obtained with gram
stain/cxs, cytology, HSV PCR.  Cell counts from LP unconcerning
for infection.  No need to start prophylactic acyclovir per
neurology.  Neurology would like patient to have EEG (can be
done as outpatient) and f/u with neurology in clinic.
.
Patient was observed [**Date range (1) 17700**] overnight with no further
evidence of seizure activity.

Chief Complaint:
Dizziness/lightheaded

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Please see MICU note for full details, briefly 25 yo F w/ Hx of
severe HTN, diagnosed while pregnant (preeclampsia) who
presented on [**11-18**] with chest pain and hypotension. Patient
reports several episodes of N/V/D last weekend but improvement
of symptoms earlier this week. She states medication compliance
as prescribed (900mg labetalol [**Hospital1 **], 90mg nifedipine QD and HCTZ
25mg QD). Prior to presentation she had an episode of SSCP that
radiated down the L arm that was accompanied by dizziness. She
was found to be severely hypotensive and given 6L of NS, 2mg
glucagon X2 for BB overdose, 10mg dexamethasone, 1g calcium
gluconate for CCB overdose, 2g Mg in the ED. EKG--> TWI in III
and aVF (unchanged from prior). A TTE was done while she was
having active CP and this was normal with an EF of 70%. CTA-->
no PE or dissection. Abd U/S--> thickened gall bladder, could be
consistent w/ cardiac or liver disease. She remained
hypotensive, started on peripheral dopamine and admitted to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU, she remained on peripheral dopamine for only a few
hours and has been off pressors for >12hrs with SBP in the
120's. This am she developed acute onset SSCP that was similar
to the episode she had on presentation. She received 3 SLN and
her pain resolved. EKG--> TWI in III, aVF and V1, and TW
flattening in V5-V6 (only new finding). CE's were drawn
initially Trop - <0.01-->0.04-->0.16; CK - 166, 141, 168; MB -
2, 4, 6; likely representing an NSTEMI. Started on heparin gtt,
ASA and statin.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
syncope or presyncope.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2105-11-18**]  2:18:56 PM


Sinus rhythm. Borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal QTc
interval. Low
T wave amplitude. Findings are non-specific but cannot exclude
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the
previous tracing of [**2105-8-9**] there is probably no significant
change.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2105-11-18**]  3:39:34 PM


Sinus rhythm. Prolonged QTc interval. Modest inferolateral lead
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Findings are non-specific but clinical
correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of same date ST-T wave changes are
more prominent.
TRACING #2

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2105-11-18**]  9:45:00 PM


Sinus tachycardia. Modest inferolateral T wave changes are

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2105-11-18**] 2:20
PM


COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No
appreciable
pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The carina
is
relatively splayed with relative underlying increased density,
which may be
due to an enlarged left atrium. The cardiac silhouette is
borderline in size,
which may be accentuated by supine, AP technique.

IMPRESSION:

1. Clear lungs.

2. Possible left atrial enlargement.

3. Borderline cardiac silhouette size, which is likely
accentuated by AP
technique and supine position.

or other acute
abnormality. The great vessels are unremarkable. The heart size
is normal
without pericardial effusion. There is a 1 cm soft tissue
density in the
right hilus, likely reactive lymph node. In the right axilla,
several
prominent lymph nodes measure up to 1 cm in short axis,
demonstrating a normal
configuration with normal fatty hila. Normal appearing left
axillary lymph
nodes are also present. In anterior mediastinum, there is soft
tissue density
material which may be due to residual thymic tissue.

Lungs demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally,
without
consolidation or pleural effusion. There is prominence of septal
markings
suggesting fluid overload and mild pulmonary edema. The
tracheobronchial tree
is patent to subsegmental levels.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Assessment of solid organs is
limited given the
arterial phase of the exam, tailored for evaluation of the
aorta. The
abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, without dissection,
pseudoaneurysm, or
other acute abnormality. The major branches are patent.
Incidentally noted
is an accessory right renal artery.

The liver demonstrates increased hypodense material surrounding
the vascular
structures at the porta hepatis and extending towards the
periphery. This
could represent periportal edema, or could indicate periductal
soft tissue
material. At the liver dome (3:81), there is a suggestion of a
6-mm
arterially enhancing focus, although this area is obscured by
metallic
artifact from an object external to the patient. A small amount
of
perihepatic fluid is noted adjacent to the diaphragm.

The gallbladder demonstrates a markedly thickened, hypodense
wall, with
intermediate density intraluminal contents. This pronounced
gallbladder wall
edema is more severe than usually seen in the setting of rapid
rehydration.
Alternatively, this could be seen in gallbladder outlet
obstruction or soft
tissue infiltration of the gallbladder wall. The pancreas
appears slightly
enlarged, although the pancreatic parenchyma enhances uniformly.
There is no
pancreatic ductal dilatation. Surrounding the pancreas, there is
fluid or
soft tissue density material and a mild amount of mesenteric
stranding.

The spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and duodenum are
unremarkable. The
kidneys are unremarkable without hydronephrosis, stones, or
worrisome renal
masses. Assessment of the mesentery is limited given the
relative lack of
mesenteric fat, but there may be some mesenteric edema. There is
no free air
in the upper abdomen.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable.
The appendix is normal. The uterus demonstrates a large
exophytic fibroid
extending off the left fundus. There is no intrauterine device
or vaginal
foreign body seen. The urinary bladder is collapsed around a
Foley catheter,
with small amount of air. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no fracture or worrisome bony
lesion.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality. No aortic
dissection in
the chest or abdomen.
2. Small amount of fluid along the superior margin of the liver,
surrounding
the pancreas, and gallbladder wall thickening versus edema, and
likely
periportal edema. These findings may be due to rapid
rehydration, but given
the phase of imaging, other etiologies cannot be ruled out.
Serum lipase was
normal making pancreatitis unlikely. This can be further
evaluated with a
non-emergent right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate the
gallbladder wall
and for perihepatic lymphadenopathy.
3. Anterior mediastinal soft tissue, most likely consistent with
thymic
tissue, although other mediastinal mass (ie lymphoma) can not be
entirely
excluded. Consider further evaluation with MRI.
4. Mild pulmonary edema.
5. Possible 6mm enhancing hepatic lesion near the hepatic dome.
This can be
further evaluated with nonemergent ultrasound or MRI.

Radiology Report LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT
Study Date of [**2105-11-18**] 6:43 PM


COMPARISON: CT torso obtained approximately four hours earlier.

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in
echotexture without
focal abnormalities. There is a small amount of perihepatic
fluid. In the
right upper quadrant, incidentally noted is a tiny right pleural
effusion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The common
duct measures 4 mm. The main portal vein demonstrates normal
hepatopetal
flow.

The gallbladder is not distended, but demonstrates marked
gallbladder wall
edema. The wall measures approximately 1.6 cm. There is no
echogenic debris
are gallstones within the gallbladder. There is no
pericholecystic fluid.

The spleen is normal in size. There is a small amount of
abdominal fluid
tracking around the spleen. Additionally, there is a small left
pleural
effusion. Views of the abdominal midline are limited due to
overlying bowel
gas.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pronounced gallbladder wall edema, without evidence of acute
cholecystitis. This can be seen in the setting of underlying
liver or heart
disease. This can also be seen in aggressive rehydration,
although this
degree of wall edema is somewhat unusual.
2. Trace ascites tracking around the liver and spleen. This may
also be
related to rehydration.
3. Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.

2. Resting hemodynamics limited to central aortic pressure
revealed
systolic and diastolic arterial hypertension with SBP 158 mmHg
and DBP
103 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with chest pain and hypotension.
She was initially admitted to the MICU as her BP remained low
after treatment for BP med overdose and 6 L IVF. Urine and serum
toxicology tests (-). In the MICU she was transiently on
dopamine but this was discontinued after only a few hours. She
has no hx of CAD only risk factors are HTN and family histroy.
Given her age, it was thought that it was unlikely NSTEMI but
given the (+) troponins, that peaked at 0.16, and her multiple
episodes of chest pain a cardaic catheterization was done. Cath
showed normal vessels. A lipid profile was done and found to be
WNL. Oncer her BP strarted to trend up she was re-started on
labetalol and HCTZ. Hypercoagulability testing was ordered prior
to discharge. Some of these results are back today and are (-),
others should be followed up. TSH was WNL.
.
# Hypotension: Patient presented with severe hypotension (SBP
60s-70s) thought to be due to excessive BP med dosing and recent
viral illness causing dehydration. This resolved after
aggressive IV hydration, BP med overdose treatment and brief
treatment with dopamine. Details as above.
.
# PUMP: Patient with no hx of cardiac abnormalities, TTE--> nl.
study with EF of 70%. Not fluid overloaded per exam. BNP WNL.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient in NSR, with no hx of arrhythmias.
.
# Anion gap: Patient with anion gap (16) acidosis, on transfer
from MICU. This resolved without intervention. Lactate was WNL.

.
# G6PD deficiency: Patient states she was told she had this
disease during childhood. No records in system. G6PD testing was
WNL in [**2096**].
.
# Pericholecystic fluid/peripancreatic fluid: This was found on
ED CT abd/pel. Surgery was consulted and concluded that this did
not represent infection/bleeding given stable Hct and completely
normal LFTs/lipase. A RUQ U/S was done which showed same finding
as before and this was thought to be due to aggresive
rehydration. Patient might benefit from reapeat RUQ U/S to
assess for resolution.
.
# Asthma: Stable, asymptomatic.
.
# Anemia: Patient was found to have Hct of 31 on admission. This
trended up throughout admission into the mid-30s range and
remained stable. Iron studies, B12/folate levels WNL.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] because you were having dizziness
and chest pain. In the ED you were found to have very low blood
pressure that was thought to be due to dehydration, because of
your previous stomach sickness, and because of too many blood
pressure mediations. You had chest pain again while in the
hospital and your blood test showed your heart was not getting
enough blood during this episode. You underwent cardiac
catheterization which was normal.

History of Present Illness:
58 year-old female, 60 pack-year smoker, with dyspnea,
hoarseness, and cough x1 month admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU [**2172-8-25**]
after found to have large mediastinal mass, today found to be
poorly-differentiated carcinoma, suspected small cell. On
initial evaluation, patient was found to have 3mm opening of
distal trachea secondary to external compression from
mediastinal mass, RUL mass, RUL collapse, and clinical findings
consistent with SVC sydrome. Y-stent was placed that evening, in
addition to Pigtail catheter for right-sided effusion. Patient
remained intubated following surgery, on paralytics due to
low-lying ET tube and small volume bleeding after endobronchial
biopsy. On [**2172-8-26**], extubated was attempted. Patient was
reintubated within 10 minutes due to neurological
unresponsiveness, hypoxia (O2 saturation 80s), and hemodynamic
instability. She was found to have a right pneumothorax, which
improved with subsequent placement of chest tube. Patient was
also noted to have pericardial effusion; given absence of
physiologic tamponade, cardiology decided against
pericardiocentesis.
.
Hospital course also complicated by hyponatremia on admission
(Na 118) attributed to SIADH and improved with fluid restriction
(Na 126). Also with hypotension (sBP 90s) following reintubation
on [**2172-8-26**]. Given hyperkalemia, hyponatremia adrenal
insufficiency was suspected; evaluated by endocrine team who
recommended stress dose steroids pending further evaluation of
etiology of hypotension. Also with non-anion gap metabolic
acidosis, transient hypothermia (T 95 [**2172-8-26**]) of unknown
etiology.
.
Per report, patient has done well today. She remains intubated,
on pressure support. Given the above pathology results, patient
is transferred to the medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) for radiation
therapy.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital 332**] medical ICU, patient is intubated,
sedated, and unable to provide history.

Imaging:
[**8-25**] CT Chest without contrast:
1. Large mediastinal mass causes narrowing of the right
pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, and trachea and occlusion
of the pulmonary artery supplying the right upper lobe in
addition to the right upper lobe bronchus. These findings are
most concerning for a primary lung carcinoma.
2. Right upper lobe collapse with nonenhancing lung parenchyma.
Tumor involvement cannot be excluded. Atelectasis of the right
lower and middle lobe.
3. Large right pleural effusion.
.
[**8-25**] Tracheal mass tissue pathology:
Immunohistochemical studies show that tumor cells are positively
stained by TTF-1 and CK7; they are negative for CK20,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin.  The tumor shows areas of
necrosis, extensive apoptosis and focal lymphatic vascular
invasion; some areas  the tumor cell size approaching that of a
small cell carcinoma, but much of the tumor has larger nuclei.
Overall, the tumor probably fits into the spectrum of a small
cell carcinoma of lung.
.
[**8-26**] Pleural fluid cytology:
Rare groups of epithelioid cells, too few to characterize
further. By immunohistochemistry: mesothelial cells stain for
calretinin and WT-1. Epithelial markers [**Last Name (un) **]-31, CEA, and B72.3
are negative. Rare cells are highlighted by TTF-1; however,
these cells are not cytologically atypical and may represent
non-specific reactivity.
.
[**8-26**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Low QRS voltage in limb leads. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**8-26**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized, primarily
anterior pericardial effusion without right ventricular
diastolic collapse. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild-moderate, primarily anterior pericardial effusion. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study is suggested.
.
[**8-27**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast:
1. Vascular findings unchanged from [**2172-8-25**]. Narrowing of SVC
and left
brachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass. The SVC is
narrowed to
approximately 5 mm over a region extending 3 cm in craniocaudal
dimension.
Indirect evidence of right brachiocephalic vein occlusion,
likely complete. Unchanged narrowing of right pulmonary artery.
Splayed but patent aortic arch branches.
2. Interval decrease in large right pleural effusion, with small
anterior
pneumothorax. Right chest tube terminating at apex.
3. No interval change in large infiltrative hypoattenuating
right
hilar/mediastinal mass.
4. No evidence of metastases in the abdomen or pelvis. Slightly
bulky left
adrenal gland without discrete nodule or mass.
5. Anasarca and small amount of peritoneal fluid collecting in
the pelvis,
likely related to edema.
6. Interval tracheal stenting with improved caliber of airway.
.
[**2172-8-27**] ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2172-8-26**], the size of the pericardial effusion is unchanged
with no signs of tamponade. The left ventricle seems to be
underfilled.
.
[**8-28**] CT Head:
1. Within limits of this modality, no evidence of enhancing mass
or edema to suggest metastatic disease.
2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomy and probable
aneurysm clipping
with encephalomalacic changes in the right frontotemporal and
left temporal lobes. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarct.

3. Probable chronic bifrontal subdural hygromas with minimal
mass effect on the subjacent frontal gyri; these may relate to
the extensive remote surgery
.
[**2172-9-2**] CT Head (performed due to worsened mental status):
1. Unchanged examination from recent exam of [**2172-8-28**].
2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomies with aneurysm
clipping and
encephalomalcia, as described above. No evidence of acute
hemorrhage or
infarct.
.
[**2172-9-3**] Renal US:
1. Mildly echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal
disease. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.
2. The left kidney remains atrophic and lobulated, similar to
[**2172-8-27**].
.
[**2172-9-4**] CT Chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p XRT and
chemo for future XRT sessions):
1. Right anterior pneumothorax has resolved.
2. Mixed response of the tumor to radiotherapy with a decrease
of the central component of the tumor and a mixed response of
the peripheral tumor components:
3. The peripheral consolidations in the right upper lobe have
overall
decreased in size, however, a new cavitary lesion has formed
measuring 11 x 19 mm.
4. The peripheral consolidations in the right lower lobe and
left lower lobe have increased in size, number and density and
may be part of post-
obstructive, post-radiotherapy, post-infectious, or acute
inflammatory
changes.
5. Lymphangio-carcinomatosis in the right upper lobe.
6. There is new small right pleural effusion and increased
moderate left
pleural effusion.
7. Left adrenal gland mass is only partially visualized in this
study.
.
[**2172-9-3**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very
disorganized and slow background rhythms. This suggests a
widespread and moderately severe encephalopathy in both cortical
and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and infection are among the most common causes. Although there
were fleeting asymmetries, there was no reliable area of focal
slowing. Encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There are
some sharp features, but no clearly epileptiform abnormalities
and no electrographic seizures.

Bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]: lots of necrotic tissue noted, ETT tube
dislodged between stent and tracheal wall, repositioned during
bronch.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**]
58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC
syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial
effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and
electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation
decompression therapy and chemotherapy. Pt developed respiratory
failure and renal failure.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially transferred
from SICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on CPAP/PS. She developed increasing
respiratory failure and was changed to AC mode.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days. Increased
hypoxia may have been due to pneumothorax, which resolved,
pleural effusions, atelectasis, possible VAP, tumor compression.
During hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, both
times of which demonstrated the ETT lodged between tracheal wall
and stent. Pt's saturation improved with repositioning.
Respiratory status also complicated by possible underlying COPD
given smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping. Pt
was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started
[**2172-8-31**] for 8 day course) for VAP. Vanco was later held as the
level was elevated in the setting of renal failure.  Patient's
family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**], and she
was terminally extubated.  Patient expired 15 minutes later from
respiratory failure and asystole secondary to lung cancer.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt had decline in mental status over
time. She initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later was
less responsive. AMS continued despite sedation being off. AMS
most likely due to toxic metabolic syndrome in setting of uremia
and multi-system organ failure. Differential also included
seizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, on
anti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although EEG did
not demonstrate focal abnormalities. LP did not demonstrate
infection or spread of malignancy. CT head [**2172-9-2**] negative for
acute process.
.
#. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably
fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given
associated SVC syndrome, prognosis poor. CT head/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis
negative for metastases.  Pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapy
and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially, XRT was clinical emergency -
normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissue
noted on bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]. Pt was to undergo formal tissue
planning session on [**2172-9-8**] to better delineate area of radiation
however family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**].
.
# Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.
Urine casts consistent with ATN. Uric acid and electrolytes
elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis
syndrome.  The next therapeutic step was dialysis as patient
became oliguric despite volume overload but the family wished
for comfort only care given dismal prognosis of her lung cancer.
.
#. Metabolic acidosis: Originally thought to be non-gap
metabolic acidosis due to hypoaldosteronism and type IV RTA.
With low albumin, however, this is a gap metabolic acidosis,
most likely due to uremia. Unable to increase RR to compensate
due to concern for auto-peeping in setting of possible COPD.
Goal pH is 7.3-7.35. On [**2172-9-5**], pt's acidosis worsened with pH
7.16-7.18. Despite adjusting ETT placement and decreasing RR to
reduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened. Bicarbonate was given.

.
# Tachycardia/Hypotension ?????? Pt with tachycardia to 140s and
episodes of hypotension to SBP low 80s. Pt with new A-fib on
telemetry and EKG. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial
effusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and ECHO
[**2172-9-5**] was unchanged from prior. No pneumothorax seen on CXR.
Unable to assess for PE by CTA as pt in renal failure and VQ
would not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology. LENI's
negative for DVT. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged bed
rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not
helpful in setting of lung changes. Even if it had been
positive, heme/onc recommended against anti-coagulation in
setting of possible tumor necrosis/hemorrhage. Pt remained
tachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses.
.
#. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt developed hypernatremia on
[**2172-9-4**] most likley due to dehydration with free water deficit
of 1.4L, started on D5W. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on
admission, both resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte
disturbances on admission- hyponatremia thought to be secondary
to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or possibly
SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommended
rechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done in
setting of pt??????s other medical issues. Hyperkalemia originally
attributed to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA, but unlikely
per endocrine because of low urine sodium.
.
#. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete
occlusion of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by
upper extremity and facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin.
Also with scleral edema. Unable to assess jugular venous
distension given considerable swelling. Seen in appoximately 10%
cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared to admission. SVC
syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor
pushing into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent
placement. She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy for
decompression.
.
#. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement
[**2172-8-25**], removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by
Light??????s criteria). Greatest concern for malignant effusion
however cytology was nonspecific.  Cultures of fluid all
preliminary negative.
.
#. Pneumothorax: Developed pneumothorax in setting of
re-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement.
.
#. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be
malignant effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous
drainage. EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does
have low voltages. Repeat ECHO done [**2172-9-5**] in setting of
hypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion.
.
# Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on
tele night of [**8-30**] with turning to right side. Occurred again
[**2172-9-4**] again with re-positioning. Metoprolol was held and
glucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity,
but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own
without intervention. Cardiology consulted who felt it was
vagally mediated. [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to ETT tube displacement
pressing on carotid when pt was turned.
.
# Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia ?????? Most likely due to chemotherapy
and no improvement in counts on neupogen. She was repeatedly
pan-cultured with negative results.
.
#. Anemia:  Normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronic
disease given malignancy.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
.
# s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  History of cerebral aneurysm
repair with a number of chronic changes on head CT.  Her
antiepileptic medications were continued.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old P3
who presented to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] with a large pelvic mass.  She had a
history of undergoing exploratory laparotomy for appendicitis
in [**2170-5-28**].  At that time a necrotic right fallopian
tube was excised and the patient was noted to have a pelvic
mass.  No further follow up until recently when she presented
to [**Hospital6 1597**] with severe anemia and a
gastrointestinal bleed.  She had a transfusion with 7 units
of whole blood.  She had a CT during her hospitalization,
which revealed a large abdominal and pelvic mass.  She had a
full gastrointestinal evaluation, which included an upper
endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow through all of
which were negative.  The patient states that during
colonoscopy the right side of the colon could not be visualized
due
to the presence of the mass.  The patient complains of nausea
and increased abdominal girth.  She has chronic constipation
and there is nothing new.  There is no other change in bowel
or urinary habits.  She denies any vaginal bleeding and any
weight loss.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for mother with breast cancer.
Sister with anal cancer and a brother with skin cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke or drink.  She is
a retired nurse.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above and otherwise noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General appearance, well developed,
well nourished, thin.  HEENT lymph node survey was negative.
Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs.  Breasts were without masses.
Abdomen was soft and moderately distended.  There was a large
palpable mass in both the upper and lower abdomen.  There was
no evidence of ascites.  Extremities were without edema.  On
bimanual examination vulva and vagina were normal.  The
cervix was normal.  Bimanual rectovaginal examination
revealed a large pelvic mass, which was somewhat ill-defined.
There was no cul-de-sac nodularity and the rectum was
intrinsically normal.

It was explained to the patient that this mass could be
benign or malignant and it was recommended to undergo
surgical excision including exploratory laparotomy, TAH/BSO
and resection of the mass.  The risks and benefits were
discussed.  Surgical consent was signed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an examination under
anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, TAH/BSO and resection of
a pelvic mass on [**2171-3-26**].  Intraoperative findings include
an enlarged uterus with a subserosal fibroid and evidence of
tumor extending to the right lateral rectoperitoneum as well
as centrally and left into the sigmoid and small bowel
mesentery up to the splenic flexure of the colon.  The
anatomic survey was otherwise unremarkable.  There was
subcentimeter periaortic lymph nodes and normal ovaries
bilaterally with 2 liters of bloody ascites in the abdomen.
Estimated blood loss 3 liters.  Secondary to the patient's
blood loss, large amount of ascites and extensive surgery,
the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
critical care.  On postoperative day zero her vital signs were
stable.  Her abdomen was
nondistended with only a small amount of drainage from the
inferior aspect of the incision.  The patient's hematocrit
was 27.2, INR 1.2, PTT 28.3, electrolytes were within normal
limits.  The patient at this time had been transferred to the
unit for further monitoring.  She had been given 7 units of
packed red blood cells.  She was in stable condition.
Postoperative day one the patient's vital signs continued to
be stable with adequate urine output overnight.  Her
examination was appropriate postoperatively.

On postoperative day one hemodynamically yesterday's
hematocrit was 27, which improved to 34 after 2 more units of
packed red blood cells.  There is no evidence of ongoing
intraabdominal bleeding.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: the patient had adequate
urine output with no evidence of
fluid overload.  Pain, the patient was on a Dilaudid PCA.  On
postoperative day two the patient was extubated.  Her pain
was controlled. She was tolerating clears.  No nausea or
vomiting.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.  She was
afebrile.  Her vital signs were stable.  She had adequate
urine output.  Her most recent hematocrit was 34.5.  Her
electrolytes were within normal limits.  Her abdomen was
appropriately tender and nondistended.

Renal: her urine output was normal.  Her Foley catheter was
discontinued.  Her creatinine was 0.6.  The patient was
encouraged to ambulate.  Her diet was advanced.

Hematology: patient had 9 units of packed red blood cells, 4
units of fresh
frozen platelets.  Her blood pressure was stable.  Her
hematocrit was 34.5.  Coumadinization was started on
postoperative day two.

Pulmonary, the patient's supplemental oxygen was weaned for
oxygenation of greater then 93%.

On postoperative day three the patient was without
complaints. She was tolerating clears.  The pain was
adequately controlled on 40 mg of OxyContin t.i.d. and
Percocet for breakthrough pain.  Cardiovascularly the patient
has a history of hypertension, which was controlled with
Lasix 40 mg q day.  The patient was deemed stable enough for
discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pelvic mass status post exploratory laparotomy, pelvic
washings, TAH/BSO, pelvic mass resection.
2.  Blood loss anemia requiring blood transfusion.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic pain syndrome.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home without
services.  She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] as an outpatient
in approximately two weeks for postoperative visit.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet.
2.  Motrin.
3.  Celexa.

Pertinent Imaging:
.
EEG: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy
states. There are no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features
noted.
.
Non-Contrast Head CT:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus, major or minor vascular
territorial
infarction. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
maintained. The
soft tissues and osseous structures are intact. The visualized
paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR:
Mild increase in interstitial markings at the left base could be
due to
bronchitis. There is no focal area of consolidation. Lungs are
otherwise
clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. There
is no pleural effusion. Mild levoscoliosis is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
33 yo F with PMH reportedly of asthma and anxiety, p/w altered
mental status and hyponatremia of unclear etiology.

# Hyponatremia: The pt presented with acute change in mental
status and was found to be hyponatremic as low as 119 (lab
details above). The patient was initially worked up for acute
change in MS including a negative CT, LP and EEG. The patient
was also given meningeal dosing for Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and
Acyclovir, which were later dc'd. Urine and serum tox were
negtaive. The patient was initially hypotensive upon admission
to the MICU to SBP in the 80s, however it was unclear what the
patients baseline SBP was in addition the patient had been given
empiric dose of ativan.

Per report, patient was undergoing bowel prep with Golytley when
became acute ill and began vomiting. Her hx indicated that she
was drinking increased hypotonic fluids including Gatorade. The
patients urine osms were low at 314, but not maximally dilute,
also with Na > 50, so not retaining maximum Na. Thus the
etiologies include sodium loss due to a recent change to low
salt diet with excessive water replacement while others included
adrenocortical insufficiency (although increased cortisol in
hemolyzed sample) and SIADH.

The patient was initially given hypertonic saline and later
changed to normal saline. The patient was water restricted and
after 24hrs her mental status cleared to baseline, however she
did not recall the prior days events. The patient was discharged
directly from the MICU to home at her baseline mental status,
only complaining of mild symptoms of nausea and headache (?
secondary to an LP) and able to take adquate but decreased POs.
.
# Anemia: The patient was previously being worked-up by GI for
BRBPR. There was no evidence of bleeding during her admission.
The pt's Hct remained stable in the mid 30s.  This should be
followed up as an outpatient. However it should be noted that
the patient appeared to become hyponatremic secondary to her Go
Lytley dosing and thus this should be addressed if the patient
is to undergo further endoscopic evaluations.
.
# Asthma: Per report. No signs of acute respiratory problems.
The pt was continued on her Albuterol PRN

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with confusion and found to have a very low
blood sodium level. This likely occurred due to your bowel prep
for colonoscopy and drinking excess water and other fluids. Your
sodium improved with intravenous fluids and your mental status
returned to baseline. A lumbar puncture was performed without
evidence of meningitis. You developed a headache that was likely
related to the lumbar puncture and should resolve on its own
over the next 24 hours.
.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
.
Call your doctor or return to the ED immediately if you
experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, sweating, fevers, chills, bleeding, or
other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
Call your PCP to schedule [**Name Initial (PRE) **] followup appointment within 2 weeks.
.
You should have your blood sodium checked on Monday, [**2167-11-3**],
at your PCP's office.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2154-6-2**] from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab, to
which she was discharged after undergoing a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
AVR on [**2154-5-17**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Hospital1 827**].  [**Hospital 38**] rehab reported increased dyspnea,
tachypnea, diarrhea, and failure to thrive over the past 36-48
hours.

Upon admission she was seen in consultation by the renal
service.  She was dialyzed during her stay and her renal
function improved markedly.  It was determined that she likely
wound not need long term dialysis.  She was also seen in
consultation by the infectious disease service during her
admission and she was placed on Vancomycin per their
recommendations.  Once it was determined that she would not
require long term dialysis access, she was re-coumadinized for
her mechanical aortic valve.  By hospital day ###### she was
ready for discharge to a rehabiliation facility.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 47 yo male with h/o DM, kidney/pancreas
transplant in [**2183**] and recent STEMI that was medically managed
in late [**12-18**] who was transferred from OSH with SOB. Hx was
obtained mostly from notes as pt quite somnolent on exam. Pt
presented to OSH today with c/o 2 weeks of progressive dyspnea
and pedal edema. His sats were 70% on RA and 92% on NRB with RR
40. He was placed on Bipap with sats 94-95% and CXR showed
whiteout in his lungs. He was treated with Rocephin,solumedrol
125 mg, 80 mg IV lasix, ativan and nitro gtt. Additionally, his
troponin T was noted to be 1.17, proBNP 70,000 (baseline
30,000), WBC 21.8 with a left shift. ABG there was 7.39/32/71.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
.
Upon arrival to the ER here his blood pressures were stable. His
sats were 98% on 15L NRB. Since he appeared to be using his
ascessory muscles he was switched to BIPAP with sats of 95%. An
additional 80 of IV lasix was administered at that time and he
put out 1.1L over the past 6 hours. CXR was done and showed
evidence of PNA. Additionally in the ER troponin was noted to
elevated and ST elevations were seen on EKG. After d/w cards it
was determined the trop was trending down from previous STEMI
and ST changes were residual from previous STEMI.
.
Currently patient is on BIPAP and answering questions
periodically and falling back asleep.


Past Medical History:
STEMI (admitted [**Date range (1) 26574**]) decided to medically manage in
the setting of renal failure and Cr of 6 and the fact that event
had likely occurred several days prior. MIBI showed EF of18%.

valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic Regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo male with h/o DM, kidney/pancreas transplant in [**2183**]
and recent STEMI that was medically managed in late [**12-18**] who
was transferred from OSH with SOB, likely PNA and CHF
exacerbation.
.
1) Respiratory failure: Patient's sats were in the 70s on RA at
OSH. CXR showed whiteout c/w bilateral patchy PNA +/- CHF
exacerbation. Following admission, patient was initially
maintained on BiPAP for what appeared to be increased work of
breathing, though sats were stable at the time. On transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], patient failed to improve clinically with diuresis,
making CHF seem less likely to be the etiology of his
respiratory failure. Bilateral patchy infiltrate was visualized;
this atypical pattern for community-acquired pneumonia raised
concerns for PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. fungal vs. multifocal bacterial pneumonia
in this chronically immunosuppressed host.  On HD#2, he was
intubated for respiratory distress. Diagnostic bronchoscopy and
BAL were performed with unrevealing culture data.  He was
initially was treated empirically for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim
discontinued due to nephrotoxicity and highly sensitive BAL
negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was treated with a 10-day course of
levaquin and vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage as no
organism was isolated.  Serum fungal markers negative for
aspergillus, equivocal for beta-glucan.  Patient remained
ventilator-dependent from [**2-12**] - [**3-1**], on CPAP + PS with ongoing
high ventilatory requirements likely due to fluid overload which
was compounded by acute oliguric on chronic renal failure.
Course was complicated by a MSSA ventilator-acquired pneumonia
which was treated with 8 days of vancomycin and zosyn.
Following improvement of renal function, we diuresed
aggressively with lasix gtt and lasix boluses.  On [**3-1**], he was
extubated despite poor prognostic indicators due to the
chronicity of his vent-dependence, with plan for tracheostomy if
he did not tolerate non-invasive respiratory support.  He was
transitioned to face-mask O2 and ultimately did not require the
planned tracheostomy.
.
2) Cardiac:
(a) Pump - Patient is s/p STEMI in [**12-18**] with resultant CHF,
last EF measured at 30% in [**Month (only) **], now 25% this admission.  On
admission, the heart failure service was consulted.  Because his
clinical status early in admission did not improve with
diuresis, we did not feel as though heart failure was the
predominant precipitating factor for his initial respiratory
failure.  However, his poor pump function and poor renal
function compounded his course significantly and led to a
protracted course on the ventilator due to worsening pulmonary
edema.  He was tried on a trial of nitroglycerin drip for
afterload reduction, which was later discontinued in favor of
hydralazine.  His beta-blockade therapy was uptitrated as
tolerated by BP.  Throughout the hospital course, he was
diuresed only as tolerated, with careful monitoring of his
tenuous renal function.
(b) Vessels - Per cards, persistent troponin elevation was
likely residual from prior STEMI, as CKMB not elevated.
Continued medical management with ASA, plavix, statin, BB. ACEI
held in the setting of ARF.
(c) Rhythm - Previously NSR with new onset paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization.  He was initially
started on beta-blocker for rate control while in the ICU.  On
[**3-3**] went into afib without resolution to Lopressor, then with
dropping blood pressure. An amiodarone drip was started, with
loading bolus of 150 mg, with improvement.  Coumadin initiated
on [**3-5**] for CVA prophylaxis in this relatively young man with
[**Name (NI) 16064**] score of 3 (1 point each for DM, HTN, and CHF); Goal INR
[**3-17**].  There was some difficulty with regulation of his coumadin
dosing as the patient became supratherapeutic likely secondary
to renal failure. His dose was held for a few days and
restarted. However, the patient refused to take the coumadin
once reinitiation was recommended because he was concerned about
having an elevated INR again. Multiple attempts were made to
encourage him to take his medications as recommended. He was
eventually started and discharged on daily oral amiodarone for
his irregular rhythm.
.
4) Anemia: NG lavage gastroccult positive. Stools reported as
guiac-negative. GI consulted on [**2-24**] for ? UGIB and EGD
deferred. Consider stress ulcer vs. OG trauma.  Iron studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  He was transfused periodically in
the setting of his low output state. His hematocrit was stable
while on the medicaly floor.
.
5) ARF: In the setting of his acute pulmonary illness, patient
developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency s/p renal
transplant x 14 years. Suspect initially pre-renal picture as
precipitant for ARF, given intravascular volume depletion. Renal
ultrasound of transplant kidney shows hypoperfusion but no
hydronephrosis (which was queried in the acute setting of
post-renal obstruction, now resolved). Likely overall picture
c/w prerenal azotemia, which resolved throughout the
hospitalization with improving Cr and improving UOP.  The Renal
service followed him throughout his stay and felt that he had no
acute HD needs despite his poorly functioning renal graft.  He
was continued on Vitamin D analogue Calcitriol for secondary
hyperparathyroidism (PTH 225).  He received Epo 10,000 units
3x/week for anemia of chronic disease.  His aAceI in the setting
of acute renal failure.  He was maintained on prednisone and
tacrolimus for chronic immunosuppression.  His tacrolimus dose
was decreased under the direction of the Nephrology service.
.
6) Urinary retention:  Patient also has unusual phallic anatomy
with penile implant, stricture, ? prostatic enlargement, and it
is possible that post-renal obstruction also contributed to the
onset of his ARF.  Following multiple nursing and house officer
attampts at foley placement, Urology was consulted and
ultimately were able to place a 12 french Coude catheter.  Had
no difficulties with urinary retention once foley discontinued.
He was restarted on flomax once his hemodynamics were stable and
tolerated it well.
.
7) FEN: Nutrional support with tube feeds was provided while
patient was ventilator-dependent.  A S&S evaluation demonatrated
possible delayed signs of aspiration.  A video swallow study was
ultimately performed which revealed moderate silent aspiration
with nectar-thick consistencies and multiple episodes of
laryngeal penetration, which were able to be cleared with cued
cough. He underwent a repeat swallow evaluaiton [**3-14**] with
improved swallowing mechanics. His diet was advanced to regular
and he tolerated it well.

While on the medical floor, the patient remained stable and was
monitored mainly for return of renal function to baseline and
medication management. It was recommended to the patient
initially that he be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for
further PT/OT. However, the patient and his wife felt very
strongly that he would be safe at home. He worked with PT
throughout his admission who felt that he was improving and was
appropriate for home PT. He was discharged home with home PT and
VNA for medication teaching. He will follow up with his Renal
and Diabetic physicians.

2. Multilevel degenerative changes with mild spinal stenosis at
C2-3 and C3-4 with minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal
cord and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C5-6 level.
Foraminal changes as above.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma service in the Emergency
Room and admitted to the hospital for further evaluation
including a syncopal work up.  The Orthopedic service placed a
[**Last Name (un) 8688**] brace on his right shoulder for closed treatment of
his humeral fracture and the Spine service wanted his C7-T1
anterolisthesis further imaged with MRI.  F/u MRI without
contrast showed no evidence of ligamentous disruption or marrow
edema in the vertebral bodies but a possible collection anterior
to the T-spine.  F/u MRI w/wo contrast showed no collection.

His carotid studies showed < 40% ICA stenosis bilaterally and
his Cardiac echo revealed an EF of 45% with basal inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis.  He denied any dizziness, chest pain
or shortness of breath but on [**2196-12-3**] became hypoxic and
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was subsequently
transferred to the ICU for further management.

A chest CTA revealed a pulmonary embolism in the RML branch and
venous studies documented a left popliteal DVT.  He was placed
on IV Heparin and Coumadin was started.  His oxygenation
improved with pulmonary toilet.  He never required reintubation.
 His chest Xray showed some LLL consolidation and he was briefly
placed on antibiotics however when the diagnosis of PE was made
the antibiotics were discontinued.

The Geriatric service followed the patient closely during his
admission and assisted with management of his PAF which was
eventually controlled with maximizing his beta blockers.  His
Coumadin was adjusted to maintain an INR of 2.5 - 3.0.

The Ortho Spine service followed Mr. [**Known lastname **] during his course
and based on his MRI recommended that he wear a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar
for 2 weeks and follow up then for another exam and possibly
more Xrays.

Physical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term
rehabilitation.

On the day of discharge, the patient was tolerating regular
diet, having bowel movements and flatus, and his pain was
well-controlled with PO pain medications.  He will need to have
further voiding trials at rehabilitation and is going with a
foley in place.

Chief Complaint:
seizure and hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
47 L handed male with PMH sig for transverse myelitis dx [**12-8**]
undergoing tx with 6mo of steroids presents from OSH with
hematemesis, gastric ulcer with visible vessel s/p EGD and
cauterization here on [**2-14**].

In [**2123-11-3**], he started developing severe lower back pain
with weakness in his legs and numbness in his hands.  He had
been diagnosed by his PCP as having back arthritis.  He was
progressively getting worse and one day he fell and could not
stand up. His symptoms did not improve and he presented to [**Hospital1 2025**]
on [**2123-11-18**] with worsened hand/LE weakness 1/5 strength,
hyperreflexia. Full spine MRI at [**Hospital1 2025**] revealed questionable mass
and intramedullary T2 hyperintense from C2-L2 with cord
expansion and patchy enhancement. Further workup for
malignancies included negative abd/chest CT and brain MRI. CSF
analysis revealed WBC 8 [L 97% M 3%], glucose 85, protein 38.
[**Doctor First Name **], RF, HSV; mycoplasma PCR, VRDL pending; Gram stain, cx
showed NG. He was started on solu-medrol 1g IV daily x5d with
considerable improvement of LE strength. Repeat MRI showed
diminished T2 hyperintesities. He was discharged to home on
[**2123-11-27**] and arranged for solu-medrol taper. He was also started
on balcofen for spasticity, and told to f/u as outpatient in
[**Hospital 878**] clinic.

Shortly after d/c of steroids, symptoms relapsed. Presented here
[**12-6**] with bacteremia, septic right knee and weakness.  At that
time pt was found to have a septic joint and gout which was
treated appropriately with antibiotics and NSAIDs.

He was later transfered to the neurology service for w/u of his
weakness.  An MRI of the head was normal, but MRIs of the spine
revealed edema and enhancement C3-C6 suggestive for lymphoma vs
sarcoid vs myelitis. A chest CT revealed pulmonary nodules. A
biopsy of the nodules were performed, which showed only lung
parenchyma, however it is uncertain that the nodules were truly
biopsied. An LP revealed increased protein, though tap was
traumatic and many RBCs were present.  CSF viral studies-->+VZV,
-EBV, and -HSV PCR.  ACE normal.  He was started on a second
course of high dose steroids 1gm soulmedrol x5days to be
followed by a 6 month course of PO steroids. Pt was d/c'd home
on [**12-30**] with improving exam.

Pt had been doing well at home with PT/OT until [**2124-2-8**], when
pt's wife noticed pt undergo a possible seizure followed by
coffee ground emesis. The pt's body stiffened. He then began
having a rhythmic shaking of the LUE for about 30 seconds. Pt
was then unresponsive for 5-10 minutes, after which he had
coffee ground emesis. He was taken to OSH, where an EGD showed a
gastric ulcer with a visible vessel and a Hct was 26. Pt was
treated with H2 blocker and d/c'd home on [**2-13**]. The following
day, pt developed a second episode, which per the wife, was
exactly like the first, and was followed by a large amount of
hematemesis. Pt taken to OSH and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**],
where a HCT on admission was 24.3. He was admitted to the MICU
for UGIB.

No abnormalities noted

MRI (c-spine)
Compared to the previous examination, there is decreased
abnormal signal within the cervical cord, largely confined to
the region of C3 and C4. There does not appear to be abnormal
cord swelling at the present time. There is still some contrast
enhancement but this also appears to be reduced compared to the
previous examination. Degenerative disease is again seen
involving C3- C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and C6-C7 essentially
unchanged compared to the previous examination. For details, see
that report.

EEG
pending

Brief Hospital Course:
1. NEURO- His last seizure was in [**2122-9-2**]. Based on his
history, probably had additional seizures before admission.
Here, he was started on Trileptal and has remained seizure free.
 MRI showed no evidence of intracranial pathology that may have
led to his recent seizures.  C-Spine MRI showed similar, though
decreased region of enhancement in the cervical cord at C3/4.
The etiology of his his cord pathology is not yet clear.  Was
thought to be neurosarcoid due to presence of pulmonary nodules,
but no clear evidence of granulomas or elevated ACE was seen.
Repeat CT of his chest here was normal, with no LAD and clear
lungs.  He has been on chronic steroids for several months
though, so his initial findings may have cleared in this
setting. In terms of malignancy, biopsy of the lung nodules was
non diagnostic in the past and the CSF cytology did not contain
adequate cells to rule this out as a possible cause.  Infectious
causes seem unlikley, but VZV was positive (pt never had clinic
varicella).  Had a repeat LP here with essentially normal cell
count, glucose, and very mildly elevated protein at 50.  This
was sent for TB-PCR and cytology.  Both pending at D/C.
  He has been on prednisone 60 mg for several months and
apparently worsened when they tried to taper him off this
medication.  We decreased him to 40 mg here and he will f/u with
neurology where they can continue to taper this as he tolerates.
  He had EEG here with no evidence of seizure activity, but his
episodes do sound suspicious for seizure.  Given this, will
continue his Trileptal as an outpt.
  Etiology of his neurological dysfunction still unclear, but
ddx includes TB, lymphoma, neurosarcoid(less likely), MS.
Apparently had diffuse enhancement of spinal cord on past MRI,
which is not classic for any of the above.  Repeat scan here is
much improved as above.  Will f/u on CSF studies.

2. GI - UGIB likely secondary to vessel in ulcer as seen on EGD.
 Received 2 units PRBCs.  This vessel was cauterized during this
admission and his Hct remained stable afterwards.  His diet was
slowly advanced and he was tolerating solids without issue by
discharge.  He did have 1 episode of heme positive stool while
here, but would expect this given his recent bleed and fact that
it was first BM since this.  No drop in his Hct with this.
Started on iron.  Also started on Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  WIll
continue this as outpt and f/u with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 10 days.

3. CV - He was ruled out for MI here.  He did have tachycardia
on telemetry with activity at times, but wasn't orthostatic.
Unclear etiology, but didn't suspect PE, dehydration,
arrhythmia.  Encouraged PO intake.  Held his ACE-I for the
majority of admission, but restarted when he was stable.  BP was
in 140s systolic without medication.

4.Gout:Continued his home allopurinol. No issues. Told pt to
avoid NSAIDS.
5.Pulm:Pt was continued on theophylline.  COuld have been
contributing to tachycardia, but has been on this for a long
time, so decided to continue it.
6.ID:Continued Bactrim for ppx as he is on high dose steroids.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old HIV
positive African-American male with a history of
polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hypertension
who was admitted to [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital on [**2177-2-10**], for
detox following a recent binge using crack cocaine (about one
gram per day), alcohol (one pint of wine per day) and Xanax
and Klonopin while on Methadone maintenance.  On [**2177-2-12**], he was noted to have fluctuating mental status
(somnolence, disorientation) and after being found down
beside his bed confused, with a bloody nose and a blood
pressure of 170/130, he was presumed to have had a seizure.
He was given 1 mg of Ativan and was brought to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.
Following a negative head CT, no further seizures and stable
vital signs, the patient was discharged back to Bornwood on
an Ativan taper.  On [**2177-2-13**], the patient was reported
to be lethargic and ataxic, with a blood pressure of 150/100.
EMT brought the patient back to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where his vital signs included a
blood pressure of 190/90, pulse of 88 and a respiratory rate
of 4, satting 94% on room air.  The patient was barely
responsive to sternal rub, with constricted pupils and was
started on Narcan, receiving a dose of 0.06 mg/hour with good
effect.  He was admitted to the MICU in the early a.m. on
[**2177-2-14**].  It was difficult to obtain additional history
from the patient at this time.  Subsequently it was learned
that the patient received some OxyContin 40 mg from a friend
while at detox, and remembers taking it prior to admission to
the hospital, although he is unclear as to what day he took
it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive since [**2162-3-12**].  A CD4 count of 78 with an
undetectable viral load was noted in [**2176-9-10**] as per the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**].  The
patient has a history of thrush as per previous dictation
summaries.  There is a question of a history of PCP in the
past.  The patient was on HAART, but this was discontinued in
the fall of last year because of decompensating liver disease
in the setting of hepatitis C.
2.  Multisubstance abuse including intravenous drug abuse.
The patient has a long-standing history of multisubstance
abuse going back 25 years that includes intravenous heroin
and cocaine abuse, benzodiazepine use including Xanax and
Klonopin, and ethanol.  The patient has been in and out of
rehabilitation facilities in the past, stays on long term
Methadone maintenance.  While the patient does admit to
recent use of cocaine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, he
denies use of heroin for several months, stating that he does
not crave heroin while he is on Methadone.
3.  Hepatitis C positive.  The patient has active hepatitis C
disease with a high viral load and is not a candidate for
therapy at this time considering his current treatment for
depression.  His albumin has been as low as 2.5 in the past
but has improved since holding HAART therapy.  He has no
history of ascites or gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
falls between Child Class B and C cirrhosis.
4.  Pan cytopenia likely secondary to HIV and ethanol abuse.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of tuberculosis exposure.
8.  History of bacterial endocarditis, Staph positive in the
past ([**2161**] and [**2168**] hospitalizations).
9.  History of sternoclavicular septic arthritis in [**2167**].
10. Status post motor vehicle accident with head trauma.
11. Bilateral leg pain and numbness secondary to peripheral
neuropathy.
12. Status post appendectomy.
13. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
14. Question of a distant history of seizure.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg q. day.
3.  Ativan 1 mg t.i.d. taper.
4.  Thiamine.
5.  Folate.
6.  Clonidine 0.2 t.i.d. p.r.n.
7.  Motrin 400 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
8.  Mylanta 30 cc q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Location (un) 686**] and has five children and several grandchildren.
He is retired since [**2172**] after working for American Airlines
as a ramp worker.  He now lives on SSI with Mass Health and
Veterans benefits that cover his medications.  As previously
mentioned, he has an extensive history of intravenous drug
abuse that includes intravenous heroin and cocaine abuse that
extends back for decades.  His recent binge was attributed to
increased depression of recent time because of his inability
to stay clean, his cirrhosis and chronic illnesses, a recent
fight with his wife, multiple deaths in the family, and an
upcoming court date next week for a DUI that he was arrested
for in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  The patient has a one pack per
day smoking history and, while he denies extensive abuse of
alcohol, he does admit to recently drinking one pint or one
bottle of wine per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergy to Bactrim that causes
him to have a rash.  The patient has an allergy to nafcillin
which has also given him exfoliative dermatitis of the palms
and soles in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is healthy at age 83.
The patient's father is 82 years old, suffering from diabetes
mellitus.  The patient has two sisters who have died of
cancer, one at the age of 58 and one who passed away in her
20's.  There is no family history of substance abuse.  There
is a question of a history of depression in the patient's
mother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At admission the patient denied
complaints of headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.  He had no complaints of
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain at the time.  No
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor
the patient had the following vital signs:  He was afebrile
with a heart rate of 75, blood pressure of 139/101, a
respiratory rate of 18 and he was saturating 100% on room
air.  General appearance:  The patient was very somnolent,
but responsive to questions and without tremulousness.  On
examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
patient was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucus membranes were
dry.  Pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light bilaterally.
The patient's neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  On
pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.  On cardiovascular
examination, there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal
S1, S2.  A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex.  On
abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended.  The
extremities were without edema or cyanosis.  On neurological
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No focal motor
deficits were appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
the following laboratories on admission:  A complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 1.9 with an ANC of
700, hematocrit of 32.5 and a platelet count of 53,000.
Chem-7 (hemolyzed) showed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 31, BUN of 13, creatinine of
0.8 and a glucose of 118.  A serum tox screen for aspirin,
ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, TCA
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES AT ADMISSION:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm, with left ventricular
hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality.  Nonspecific ST
changes were observed.  Q2 prolongation that is new on this
EKG was observed compared with previous [**2170-12-16**] EKG.
2.  Chest x-ray:  Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with
prominent left ventricle contour.  Wide thoracic aorta.  No
evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates.
3.  Head CT:  Head CT from [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit
showed mild focal dilatation, with a normal ventricular
system.  No midline shift, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage was
observed.  Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted.

IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION:  This is a 45-year-old
African-American male with a history of polysubstance abuse,
HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with
stuporous mental status changes from detox facility.  This
was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose, as the
patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency
Department.  Infection as a possible etiology for mental
status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV
positive patient with his last CD4 count of 78.  However, the
patient does recall taking an extra 40 mg of OxyContin prior
to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of 55
mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started
on after his [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit, making
overdose more likely.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Neurological:  Patient's mental status changes which
included increased lethargy to stuporousness, pinpoint pupils
and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone,
benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most
likely cause of this patient's presentation.  The patient
showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until [**2177-2-15**], with dramatic improvement in the patient's state of
alertness.  Other causes for his change in mental status
included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol,
electrolyte abnormalities, infection, intracranial processes,
as well as renal hepatic disease.  For that reason,
electrolytes were followed, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
levels were sent.  An LP was also performed.  The patient was
pan cultured, including cultures for blood, urine and
cerebrospinal fluid.  Because of the patient's history of
alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use
likely on [**2177-2-10**], there was a possibility of
withdrawal in this patient, so a CIWA protocol with diazepam
q. 4h. for a score greater than 10.  Clonidine p.r.n. was
also continued for the possibility of developing opiate
withdrawal.  In this patient with depression, his Prozac was
held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  A Neurology
consult felt that the seizure on [**2177-2-12**], was most
likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both
alcohol and benzodiazepines.  As recent cocaine was evident
in the urine tox screen, there was some concern of a cerebral
infarct, but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination
made this less likely.  Liver function tests and ammonia were
also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C.

Patient's laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2177-2-14**], included a calcium of 8.0, magnesium of 1.4
and a phosphate of 3.1.  The patient's PT was 13.7, INR was
1.2 and PTT was 37.7.  The patient had an elevated AST of
101, an ALT of 52, an alkaline phosphatase of 129, and a
total bilirubin of 0.8.  His albumin was 2.7 and was repeated
that same day and found to be 3.1.  Amylase was 98 and lipase
was 63.  The patient had an ammonia elevated to 95 with no
history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past.  A
urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and
negative for benzodiazepines.  An LP was performed on [**2177-2-14**], which showed 0 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells,
a protein of 37, and a glucose of 57.  The Gram stain was
negative for PMNs, no microorganisms were seen.  Cryptococcal
antigen was not detected, and fluid, acid fast, viral, and
fungal cultures were sent.

2.  Infectious Disease:  This patient is HIV positive and
hepatitis C positive, and it is possible that infection could
also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes.  As
mentioned he was pan cultured, including blood, urine, CSF
and stool cultures.  Tests for CD4 count and viral load were
sent.  The patient reported that he has not been on
retrovirals since the fall of last year.  Liver function
tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis,
and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation.
Throughout the patient's duration in the Intensive Care Unit,
he did not complain of fevers, shortness of breath or
productive cough, dysuria, or other complaints suggestive of
infectious process.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's respiratory rate improved on
Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no
need to intubate.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of hypertension and
has used beta blockers in the past.  He has not been on his
hypertensive medication during the past several days while at
detox.  His pressures remained elevated while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  In the evening of [**2177-2-14**], he was
hypertensive to 206 and was given a dose of hydralazine for
control of his pressure.  Subsequently, lisinopril 5 mg q.
day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day were begun to better
control his pressure.  The patient's EKG showed an increased
QT prolongation from prior EKG, in the setting of a potassium
of 3.4 upon repeat Chem-7 on [**2177-2-14**].  It was unclear
that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking
should be associated with causing this QT prolongation.  The
patient's potassium was repleted.

5.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was noted on
CBC.  This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit.

6.  Renal/Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
was given maintenance fluids of one-half normal saline 100 cc
per hour.  These were maintained until the patient's mental
status improved.  He began tolerating p.o.'s on [**2177-2-15**].  Because of the patient's elevated ammonia, he was
placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate
p.o.'s.  Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted
as necessary, with potassium and magnesium requiring
repletion.  The patient was placed on thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin considering the patient's history of alcohol
abuse.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of cirrhosis
in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in [**2176-9-10**] with a history of ethanol abuse.  He has had elevated
transaminases, PT and albumin of 3.1 and elevated ammonia.
Lactulose was started at 30 cc t.i.d., titrated to less than
two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia.  Hepatitis
C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be
followed as an outpatient.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcu heparin and
Pepcid IV q. day.

SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient's mental
status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned
over 12 hours to a respiratory rate greater than 11.
Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay.  The patient
was able to tolerate p.o.'s prior to transfer.  Vital signs
were stable, although his blood pressures remained elevated
prior to transfer.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] [**Company 191**] Service on [**2177-2-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR ([**2177-2-15**] to [**2177-2-17**]):
1.  Neurological:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and
oriented with some depressed mood.  He did complain of some
symptoms of nausea, chills, diaphoresis, aches and pains,
diarrhea, that he thought were consistent with his typical
withdrawal symptoms.  He was continued on the CIWA protocol
with p.r.n. diazepam, and clonidine was continued for his
complaints of opiate withdrawal.  His Methadone was begun on
the floor at a dose of 55 mg q. day.  Lactulose was also
considered in light of his elevated ammonia, although
encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with
no asterixis or additional changes in mental status.  We
continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood
cell count of 1.7, hematocrit of 32.6 and a platelet count of
47,000, with an ANC of 740.  Electrolytes showed a sodium of
137, potassium 3.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.5 and glucose 98.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium
1.8 and phosphate was 3.0.  While the PT and INR were now
normal, PTT remained slightly elevated at 39.  The patient
was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which
he declined.  The patient's mental status continued to be
stable during his stay on the floor, with no signs of overt
anxiety, hallucinations, instability, but the patient was
somewhat depressed and nervous, which he admitted was
primarily due to his worry about personal stressors.  His
symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his
second and third days on the floor.  Prozac was restarted on
his last day of admission for depression.  It appeared that
the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal,
however, his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout
his stay but without tachycardia.  The patient's symptoms of
opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his
Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive
one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day, and requested
clonidine on his final day of admission p.r.n.  However, the
patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years
physically but admits that it is psychological problems and
depression that make him feel most concerned at this time.
We had several discussions with the patient regarding the
seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor
outcome if he continues such risky behaviors, as this
overdose might have been life threatening.  The patient is
actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his
current health situation, living environment (""my
neighborhood is full of drugs""), and life stressors (several
deaths in the recent past in his family).

2.  Infectious Disease.  The patient's CD4 count was found to
be 48 during this admission and his viral load is still
pending.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
admission, without complaints of fever, productive cough,
dysuria, abdominal pain, or other clinical signs concerning
for infection.  Blood, stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
have been negative to date.  Prophylaxis was begun for PCP
with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient
with a history of thrush.  However, fluconazole was
discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not
indicated routinely in HIV positive patients.  As the
patient's CD4 count is below 50, toxoplasmosis titers were
also sent, and should be followed up for possible
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an
outpatient.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient's EKG was repeated on [**2177-2-16**], and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG,
with suddenly prolonged QT interval.  Potassium was also 3.2
on [**2177-2-16**], and was repleted.  The patient's blood
pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the
floor, in the 150's to 180's over 90's to 100's.  The dose of
lisinopril was increased to 10 q. day, and it was decided
prior to discharge to change the patient's blood pressure
regimen to 10 mg lisinopril b.i.d., to discontinue the
hydrochlorothiazide, and to begin Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was breathing comfortably with
normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air
throughout his stay on the floor.  While the patient
complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor, he
developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious
respiratory infection.  This patient does have previous
hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP
pneumonia in the past.

5.  Renal.  The patient had normal creatinine throughout his
hospital stay.  His urinalysis was negative except for a
negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver
disease.  Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which
was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be
treated.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient's lytes
were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor.
Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted
with 40 mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and
was increased to 60 mEq on [**2-17**].  He was maintained on a
low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was
up to 148 on his day of discharge.  He was continued on
thiamine, folate and multivitamin and additional B12 and
folate studies were sent and are still pending.  He tolerated
p.o. liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the
floor.  No complaints of nausea or vomiting.

7.  Gastrointestinal.  In this patient with hepatitis C
positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at 2.8 on [**2177-2-16**].  We continued to follow an ammonia which was 148 prior
to discharge, and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the
patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission.
The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver
disease and seemed most concern with this of his health
issues.  Unfortunately, Interferon therapy may be
contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms
of depression.  As an outpatient it would be recommended that
he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his
liver disease.  While this patient has no prior history of
gastrointestinal bleed, we began Imdur for GI prophylaxis,
and it is recommended that he have an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient.

8.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was stable while
on the floor.  The patient did complain of a nose bleed one
morning in the setting of low platelet count that he
described as robust, but which stopped easily and did not
recur.  In light of the patient's pan cytopenia which may be
likely due to ethanol use, HIV, liver disease, it was thought
that B12 and folate should also be checked.

9.  Prophylaxis.  The patient remained on heparin subcu
b.i.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. throughout his stay
on the floor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.  He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than
8 during his last three days on the floor.  Methadone
maintenance was restarted with good effect.  He was primarily
concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety, a
safe drug-free environment, his chronic health issues, family
stressors, and tomorrow's pending court appearance.
Depression, for these reasons, is a concern in this patient
who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to
[**Hospital 10073**] Hospital, where he was first admitted last Monday
([**2177-2-10**]) to begin a detox program prior to this
hospitalization.  He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue
his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address
his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse.  [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital is
located at [**Street Address(2) 10074**] in [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 10075**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Thiamine 100 mg q. day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Dapsone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
6.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q. day.
7.  _____ 10 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ativan 1 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
11. Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Imdur 30 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**], after discharge to set up a
follow-up appointment in one week if he desired to continue
having her involved in his care.
2.  As the patient mentioned a desire to transfer his care
from the V.A. Hospital, as he has had some negative
experiences there in the past, we have set up an appointment
for him with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Associates, [**Hospital1 1444**], for this Thursday, [**2-20**], at 2:00 p.m., the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  At this
appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending
laboratory studies which include pending cultures, his viral
load, his toxoplasmosis cultures.  Also potassium and ammonia
levels should be checked at this time.  As the patient's
blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay
and his blood pressure control medications are still being
optimized, his blood pressure should be checked during this
visit and modification of his medical regimen should be
considered.  Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers, the
patient should be considered for a toxo and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
considering his CD4 count of 48.  Also consider a hepatitis A
vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient.  As
this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT
interval on EKG, it would also be useful to recheck an EKG
during this visit.  While this patient has had no complaints
of gastrointestinal bleed in the past, he should be sent for
endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient.  The patient
has also been requesting psychiatric and/or social work
support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a
support network to help him with his depression and with the
numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care
problems.  This patient should also be set up to be followed
in the [**Hospital3 **].
3.  The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic
at [**Hospital1 69**] this Thursday with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-20**] at 12:40 p.m.  This visit is
important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral
neuropathy, which the patient states have been a factor in
his persistent drug use.
4.  Continue with Methadone maintenance program as previous
to admission.
5.  Consider contacting [**Name (NI) 10076**] for acupuncture treatments as
the patient has requested this therapy which has worked for
him in the past.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Opioid and benzodiazepine intoxication.
2.  Polysubstance abuse.
3.  HIV positive.
4.  Hepatitis C positive.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.

EKG:
irregular. rate 130 bpm. nl axis. narrow qrs. LVH. ST depression
in II, aVF, V4-6

CXR ([**2176-4-22**]):
There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which
lies 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen extending
below the diaphragm and out of view. Patient is slightly rotated
on current radiograph, limiting evaluation. Marked global
cardiomegaly is probably unchanged. Mediastinal widening is
difficult to assess given the degree of rotation. No focal
consolidations are seen, and there is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

ABD US ([**2176-4-22**]):
Cholelithiasis without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.

ECHO ([**2176-4-23**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-3-8**],
global
biventricular systolic function is similar. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure are now lower (may be related to technical
quality rather than a true decline).

XRAY SHOULDER and HIP and WRIST ([**2176-4-23**]):
Mild left acromioclavicular joint arthrosis. No fracture. No hip
fracture.
Wrist - Diffuse demineralization.
Mild degenerative change about the articular surfaces of the
scapholunate interval. The intercarpal spaces are normal on this
non-stress view.

CT HEAD ([**2176-4-23**]):
No intracranial hemorrhage. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic

changes.

CT CHEST ([**2176-4-23**]):
1. New large left pleural effusion, predominantly loculated.
2. Bronchomalacia bronchus intermedius. Possible air
extravasation.
3. Marked cardiomegaly, especially right atrial enlargement due
to tricuspid insufficiency. Pulmonary hypertension.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be
excluded.
5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slightly increased, most likely
reactive, but other causes such as neoplasm can not be excluded.


CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2176-4-28**]):
1. Decrease in left pleural effusion, status post left pleural
catheter. Loculated effusion persists in the anterior pleural
space with new focal areas of air within the effusion that could
be secondary to recent intervention.
2. Increasing atelectasis with consolidation of the right lower
lung with opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus with
endobronchial secretions.
3. Persistent cardio megaly and small pericardial effusion.
4. Right renal cysts


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hemoptysis/anemia:
In setting of supratherapeutic INR (22) and pulmonary
hypertension. Bleeding stopped once INR reversed. Bronchoscopy
initially showed large clot across the carina but no active
bleeding. Repeat bronchoscopy showed slight ooze from LLL. Again
no active bleeding but a large clot. IP subsequently came and
removed the clot.  After INR reversal and clot removal, patient
no longer had hemoptysis and hematocrit remained stable.

2. Respiratory failure (pneumonia and pleural effusions):
Patient intubated in ED for hemoptysis. Extubated the following
morning but had increasing respiratory difficulty through out
the day and was re-intubated in early evening. In addition to
hemoptysis and heart failure, patient developed aspiration
pneumonia. Sputum showed GPC on gram stain but cultures negative
(taken while on levofloxacin). Vancomycin was added. CT scan of
the chest showed left loculated pleural effusion that was tapped
on [**4-25**] by IR showed 4+ PMNs but no organism.  IP further
drained the L posterior loculated fluid (~900cc) and a pigtail
catheter was placed on [**2176-4-26**].  The pigtail catheter can be
removed when drainage stops.  Pt developed fever on [**4-27**] despite
being on vanc/levofloxacin and aztreonam was added after
panculture was obtained.  Repeat CT chest subsequently showed
improved L posterior pleural effusion, unchanged L loculated
pleural effusion (too small to tap) and increased opacities in
the RLL.  Because all her sputum, pleural fluid cultures were
negative, vancomycin and aztreonam were discontinued on [**4-29**] and
[**4-30**], respectively.  A 10 day course of Levaquin was completed.
Patient was extubated successfully on [**4-29**], and at the time of
transfer was satting well on room air.

3. Coagulopathy:
On coumadin for a fib. Her coumadin dose was increased a week
prior to admission.  Unclear why INR so dramatically elevated.
Reversed with FFP and PO vitK. and had no longer hemoptysis.

4. Congestive heart failure, diastolic:
Initially BB/diuretics were held due to hypotension.  They were
reintroduced once hemodynamically stable.

5. Atrial fibrillation:
Initially held BB given hypotension.  Metoprolol was readded to
control her rate (and titrated up).  Her elevated INR was
reversed as above.  Given her recurrent falls per family and
hemoptysis, patient was not felt to be a good candidate for
anticoagulation; given her aspirin allergy, Plavix was started.

6. Renal failure:
Likely in the setting of blood loss and hypertension.  SCr 1.0
at the time of discharge after peaking to 1.5 on admission.

7. Mental status change:
After arriving to the floor, the patient would become mildy
agitated at night and would also become disoriented.  This was
felt to be secondary to narcotics provided earlier in her stay.
Her pain regimen was changed with the hope to minimize narcotics
use.  Tylenol RTC was given and a Lidocaine patch was applied to
her left flank.  Low doses of oxycodone IR and Ultram were used.
 Geriatrics was consulted and recommended low dose of [**Hospital1 **] Haldol
and re-institution of Klonopin, given that the patient presented
on chronic benzoes.  This worked well and the patient improved
greatly with no issues over the final 3-4 days of her stay.

8. Pain:
The patient presented with a history of chronic pain.  Based on
prior PCP notes, multiple regimens have been tried with no only
moderate success.  At the time of discharge, her pain regimen
was as outlined in #7.  Consideration could be given to
eliminating oxycodone in favor of the Ultram if the latter is
working well.

9. Hypertension:
Presented on Nifedipine SR 60mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily and
Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  The first two medications were not
restarted before discharge, but likely could be as the patient's
blood pressure was no optimized.  The metoprolol was initially
held, then restrated and titrated to 100mg TID.

10. Obstructive sleep apnea:
CPAP settings are -- Mask Ventilation: Nasal CPAP w/ PSV (BIPAP)
Inspiratory pressure: 8 cm/h2o Expiratory pressure: 5 cm/h2o
Backup rate: 10 bth/min Supp O2: 2 L/min.

11. Hyperglycemia: Blood glucose 223 on admission finger sticks
as high as 160s thereafter.  Sliding scale inslulin was used
during stay.  [**Month (only) 116**] require oral hypoglycemics.

who was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 93626**] for decitabine and was
in outpatient center today for platelet transfusion for dropping
plt count (22) and nosebleeds. She tolerated the infusion but on
her way home, she developed rigors, chills and she returned to
the outpatient unit. Upon arrival, she was hypertensive and had
a temp to 99.8. She was given benadryl, demerol, tylenol,
hydrocortisone. She subsequently became hypotensive to 90/40 and
received IVF bolus. She had intermittent, mild hypoxia 93-96%.
  She was thought to have a transfusion reaction (work-up
ordered) but her labs were notable for neutropenia and she was
referred to the ED for admission.

In ER: (Triage Vitals: 99.1 85 118/50 18 93% RA) CBC notable for
hct 19.6 from 24.9 earlier in the day. hemolysis labs negative.
CXR revealed mild interstitial edema. CT scan was performed to
r/o a RP bleed.

Currently, she feels completely well. She reports that she felt
while prior to the platelet infusion and denies any fever,
chills, abd pain, N/V/D, cough, headache. Her only concern is a
bruise/canker sore in her L mouth which is mildly tender.

.
Imaging:
========
[**4-1**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Calcified pleural plaque is better
assessed on the prior CT. There is mild interstitial edema with
no large effusions or pneumothorax. No signs of pneumonia.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Calcified
tracheobronchial tree noted. Bony structures are intact
.
[**4-1**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute intra-abdominal or
pelvic process. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stable gallbladder polyp. Stable gallbladder polyps versus a
focus of adenomyomatosis within the gallbladder fundus. Sigmoid
diverticulosis. Patchy bibasilar opacities within the lung
bases, with subpleural scar formations and bronchiectasis within
the lung bases.
.
[**2195-4-8**] CT head without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Slightly
dense appearance of the cortex lateral to the Sylvian fissure (
se 2, im 12) is likely related to volume averaging rather than
hemorrhage; a follow up can be considered if necessary. No prior
CT studies are available.
2. Bilateral mastoid opacification from fluid/mucosal thickening

.
CTA [**2195-4-18**] Abd-Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. No contrast extravasation to suggest GI bleeding.
2. Stable gallbladder polyp and fundal adenomyomatosis.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Small left adrenal adenoma.
5. Unchanged Focal celiac artery and aortic dilation as
described above.
.
Colonoscopy:
============
[**3-1**] Colonoscopy prior to this admission:
Abnormal mucosa in the colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
colon. A small posterior rectal fissure was noted in the anal
canal. This was not bleeding. Blood was noted throughout the
entire colon.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
.
[**2195-4-3**] colonoscopy:
Non bleediong diverticulosis of the whole colon. Bleeding
angioectasias in the cecum treated with APC. Polyp in the
transverse colon. Blood and stool throughout colon. Non bleeding
posterior anal fissure.
.
[**2195-4-13**] colonoscopy:
Blood in the whole colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
and descending colon. Ulcers in the cecum. A large adherent
blood clot was found in the cecum with surrounding oozing of
bright red blood. Given the risk of uncontrollable bleeding in
the setting of low platelets, the clot was not removed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical
history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen,
diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**]
in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with
thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per
rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat
colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire
colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon
Plasma coagulation. She required a second colonoscopy for
repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to
the cecum. She remained stable for a while then had frequent
bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip
for 8 hours. Gradually her platelets started to increase. After
these events, she remained stable and was discharged home in
stable condition. She will require HLA matched platelet
transfusions in the future if needed.
.
# cecal AVMs:  She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright
red blood per rectum. The patient developed BRBPR, and was found
to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC. Specifically, repeat
colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively
bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.
Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on
[**2195-4-3**].  During her stay she required several units of PRBC and
platelets. After remaining stable, she was transferred back to
the floor however she had the same situation again and was
transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy
which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the
clot. The clot was not removed (not amenable to endoscopic
management). GI recommended surgical consult for possible
resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet
counts, they felt this will not be a favorable management. After
having stable H/H, she was transferred back to the floor. While
on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the
night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which
required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the
40-50's). CTA was negative. Following this, she did not have any
further significant bloody stools. She remained vitally stable
with stable H/H and gradually rising platelet count.
.
# thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML
concerns. Concern for consumptive process following transfusion
of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however
Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no
evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers. The
patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when
first admitted. She was premedicated with anti-histamines. While
the patient was actively bleeding, she was also given Amicar (2
grams IV with 1gram/hour IV infusion overnight on [**2195-4-2**]). This
was repeated over the night of [**4-17**] as above. She was found to
have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all
subsequent transfusions. Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross
for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister
however since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not a
suitable option. Of note, her platelet count was improving
already and did not require further platelet transfusions.
Platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge.
.
# transfusion reaction/PRA positive: The patient had transfusion
reaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once while
on the floor). She was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl,
and hydrocortisone. A blood bank work up was initiated, and the
patient was given group specific platelets. She was found to be
PRA positive and requires HLA matched platelets. However, during
her second episode of BRBPR on [**4-12**], it was found that there was
no more HLA matched platelets available in [**Location (un) 86**] area. Red
Cross was contact[**Name (NI) **] for more HLA matched platelets. Sister was a
potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her
anti-platelet therapy as above. She did not require further
platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to
increase.
.
# MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the
floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and
her neutrophil count was trending down.  It was then decided to
start her on second cycle of Dacogen (day 1 = [**2195-4-8**]).  The
patient tolerated the Dacogen well, with little side effects.
12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge.
.
# GERD: The patient was continued on her home PPI.
.
# constipation:  The patient has a history of severe
constipation, however, her home medications were held in the
setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given
resolution of bloody bowel movements.
.
Transitional Issues:
- The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood
bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive;
she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent
transfusions.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital because you had a
transfusion reaction after getting platelets at clinic.  We did
some tests and found that you will need specially screened
platelets from now on because your body reacts to normal
platelets.

While you were here, you also developed some bleeding from your
rectum.  You were transferred to the intensive care unit and
they gastrointestinal doctors looked into your intestines with a
camera and found some areas of bleeding called AV malformations
that were clipped. After this, you were sent to the floor then
sent back to the ICU when you had further bleeding. Second
colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your
colon in the same area where the AVM's were clipped. Your blood
level was stable as well as your blood pressure and you were
transferred to the floor.

While on the floor, you had a few loose bloody stools that
subsequently resolved. Your diet was gradually advanced and you
tolerated it well prior to discharge. Your platelets gradually
increased and it was in the 80's on your discharge day.

The surgeons evaluated you for possible surgical removal of part
of your colon, however they felt it is unsafe to do surgery for
the moment. We did not discharge you on Amicar which is a clot
stabilizer medication since you did not have further bloody
stools, your blood level was stable and your platelets were
gradually increasing.

We also noticed some changes in your blood work that made us
think that your leukemia was acting up again; because of that we
started you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy.  You
tolerated the chemo well.
.
While in the hosiptal, it was noted that occasionally your blood
pressure was high and you were started on a medication for brief
time. However, given your GI bleeds, this was held. We will not
discharge you at the moment with anti-hypertensive medication.

We did the following changes in your medication list:
- Please stop allopurinol

Please continue the rest of your home medications the same way
you were taking them at home prior to admission.

Your PICC line was removed prior to discharge.

It will be important for you to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Please follow with your appointments as illustrated below.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2149-10-3**], this 33-year-old G6,
P5 underwent a dilatation and evacuation which was
complicated by a uterine perforation and injury to the
sigmoid mesentery.  An intraoperative Surgery consult was
obtained.  The Surgery Team recommended a partial resection
of the denuded bowel.  The patient underwent a
resection and an end-to-end reanastomosis.  The patient also
underwent a repair of the uterine perforation as well as a
tubal ligation.   Intraoperatively, the patient received a
total of four units of packed red blood cells, two units of
FFP and 1500 cc of hetastarch.  Please see the full operative
note for details.

1.  Hematology:  Intraoperatively, the patient's hematocrit
nadired at 14.  As previously stated, the patient received a
total of four units of packed red blood cells and two units
of FFP intraoperatively.  After surgery the patient was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where serial
hematocrits were followed.  The patient's laboratories were
notable for a likely dilutional as well as consumptive
coagulopathy.  On the first night after surgery, the
patient's hematocrit fell to 19.5.  Her platelets were 84,000
and her INR was elevated at 1.5.  On the first postoperative
day, the patient received an additional two units of packed
red blood cells, two units of FFP and four units of
cryoprecipitate.  On postoperative day number two, the
patient received an additional two units of packed red blood
cells so the total products she received were eight units of
packed red blood cells, six units of FFP and four units of
cryoprecipitate.  Her hematocrit stabilized at 29 and her INR
stabilized at 1.1.  The patient's platelets slowly increased
to 128,000 on discharge.  The patient had no further problems
with bleeding during the hospitalization.

2.  Neurology:  The patient was originally intubated and
sedated and was given a morphine drip for pain.  This was
continued through postoperative day number one and the
propofol was weaned on postoperative day number one and she
was extubated later that day.  The patient was started on a
Dilaudid PCA for pain which she used until postoperative day
number five.  The patient was then changed to Percocet and
Motrin which she tolerated well.  The patient was discharged
on Percocet and Motrin.

3.  Pulmonary:  As previously stated, the patient was
intubated until postoperative day number one.  During the
first postoperative day, the patient had wheezing consistent
with an underlying asthma.  The patient was given albuterol
with good response.  The patient was extubated on
postoperative day number one at which time incentive
spirometry was encouraged.  The patient had no further
problems from a pulmonary prospective during the
hospitalization.

4.  Coronary:  The patient was stable from a coronary
prospective throughout the hospitalization.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient initially was NPO with
intravenous fluids and had an nasogastric tube placed.  The
nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day number one.
The patient was NPO until postoperative day number four.  The
patient began passing flatus at this time and began to take
sips.  The patient tolerated sips without a problem, was
advanced to clears, and by postoperative day number six was
tolerating solids.  The patient was initially on intravenous
Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis which was stopped
on postoperative day number four.  On the evening of
postoperative day number four, the patient complained of
midsternal/epigastric pain.  The patient was restarted on
intravenous Protonix with good relief.  An electrocardiogram
was done at the time which was within normal limits.

6.  Genitourinary:  After the surgery, the patient received
two doses of 1000 mcg of Cytotec per rectum for uterine
atony.  The patient was also started on Methergine .2 mg q. 6
hours times 48 hours.  The patient's bleeding was appropriate
and she did not require any further uterotonics.  The patient
had a Foley catheter until postoperative day number three.
After the catheter was removed she had no difficulties
voiding.

7.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was originally started
on ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin.  She received a
total of 36 hours of these antibiotics.  The patient was
afebrile during the entire hospitalization.  The patient was
started on no further antibiotics.

8.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was on Pneumoboots beginning on
postoperative day number zero.  On postoperative day number
two, the patient complained of some left thigh pain and
swelling.  Although the clinical suspicion was low, the
patient underwent a bilateral lower extremity Dopplers to
rule out deep vein thrombosis and the ultrasound was
negative.  The patient was also on intravenous Protonix for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

9.  Support:  The patient was seen by Social Work during her
admission and was encouraged to contact Dr. [**Name (NI) **] if
she needs any additional support after discharge.

The patient was discharged to home on postoperative day
number six.  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] in one week and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] from General
Surgery in two weeks.  The patient was discharged to home on
Percocet 5/325, Motrin and Colace.

History of Present Illness:
67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with
fever to 100.7, WBC 18.7, and erythema at superior aspect of
wound. Pt recently had a long hospitalization following CABG and
MVR/AVR([**Date range (3) 83151**]), which was complicated by post-op
CVA, aflutter/afib with unsuccessful cardioversion, and a
HA-pna. The pt was discharged with a trach to [**Hospital3 **],
due to his inability to manage secretions. The pt did well at
rehab, until [**2125-10-4**], when he developed a low-grade fever and
CXR showed a new left lung base consolidation. He continued to
have temps to 99, and on [**10-14**] pt was started on ceftriaxone 1g
q24h. On [**10-15**] the pt was also started on vancomycin 1g q12h. Per
rehab reports the pt developed confusion and RR in the high
30's. The pt was thought to be in volume overload, and was given
lasix 20mg IV once on [**10-17**]. Gram stain of sputum from [**10-14**] showed

CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical stranding in the anterior mediastinal space. No
fluid
collection.
2. Tracheostomy tube is 7.6 cm from the carina.
4. Right PICC loops superiorly, malpositioned; consider
readjustment.
5. Mitral and aortic valve replacement.
6. Left moderate-sized pleural effusion and bibasal atelectasis.

7. Gynecomastia.

CXR [**2125-10-24**]
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
[**2125-10-22**].
The tracheostomy tip is 6.5 cm above the carina. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. The replaced mitral valve is in place.
There is
bilateral pleural effusion and right lower lobe opacity that
might represent a combination of atelectasis and infectious
process. The left retrocardiac atelectasis has also progressed
and might represent an additional source of infection as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with
fever to 100.9, WBC 18.7 admitted with possible pneumonia and
cellulitis, rule out mediastinitis.

# Fever/Pseudomonal pneumonia: Pt had CT chest that indicated
some stranding around sternum, but thoracic surgery did not
think CT was consistent with mediastinitis, but that changes
were characteristic of post-op changes. No evidence of
cellulitis on exam, and although PICC line appeared normal, it
was removed for concern for line infection. Pt found to have new
ventilator-associated pneumonia, and had bronchoscopy that
showed copious secretions. Sputum grew multi-drug resistant
pseudomonas. During the admission the pt was thought to have had
a ceftriaxone allergic reaction (morbilloform drug rash) and
ceftriaxone was added to allergy list. Pt was discharged to
rehab on tobramycin with plan to complete a 14 day course, that
will be complete on [**2125-11-4**]. He will need his tobra level
checked every 3 days to see if his dose needs adjustment. Renal
function should be checked q3 days while on the tobra to ensure
proper dosing.

# Cardiovascular: EKG improved from prior. No chest pain.
Continued amiodarone, coumadin, statin, aspirin and restarted
beta blocker at a lower dose.

# H/o CVA: Left hemiparesis improved as L LE now has some
strength. He was continued on his statin, aspirin, and coumadin.


# FEN/GI: Continue home Jevity.

# GERD: was continued on home ranitidine
# Access: new PICC line was placed during his admission, old
PICC was removed and had a negative culture.
# Communication: With sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83152**], and
patient
# CODE STATUS: FULL CODE

Was tranfered to rehab for continued care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13469**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2131-3-5**] and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled
with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a
scheduled T11-L3 anterior fusion through a thoractomy. Please
refer to the dictated operative note for further details. The
second surgery was also without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT
was stable. HD#3 she returned for a scheduled T4-S1 posterior
fusion. Postoperative hematocrit was low and she was transfused
multiple units of packed cells and platelets.  She was
transfered to the T/SICU from close monitoring.  Her chest tube
was removed POD2 from the third procedure.  A bupivicaine
epidural pain catheter placed at the time of the posterior
surgery remained in place until postop day one from the third
procedure. She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then
diet was advanced as tolerated.
She developed a persistently elevated white count and a medical
consult was obtained.  A thorough workup was conducted but
returned negative for a source.  She remained afebrile and on
HD#9 her leukocytosis decreased.
The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when
tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3 from the third
procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar warm-n-form brace for
comfort. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to
ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day
of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

sitting in a chair or while lying in bed.



-Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days. If the incision is
draining cover it with a new sterile dressing. If it is dry then
you can leave the incision open to the air. Once the incision is
completely dry (usually 2-3 days after the operation) you may
take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a bath or pool. If
the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not
get the incision wet. Cover it with a sterile dressing. Call the
office.



-You should resume taking your normal home medications. No
NSAIDs.



-You have also been given Additional Medications to control your
pain. Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic
prescriptions, so please plan ahead. You can either have them

CXR [**11-2**]: A left internal jugular vascular catheter remains in
satisfactory position. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
stable. There is some degree of respiratory motion present,
resulting in blurring of the pulmonary vasculature. This limits
assessment for mild congestive heart failure. Bilateral pleural
effusions are present and are partially layering on this
semi-erect study. Increased opacity persists in the left
retrocardiac region.

AXR [**11-2**]: Gas present in colon.  No abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo F presented with sepsis, transfered to ICU on arrival.  In
the ICU, a sepsis protocol was initiated.  Coverage of multiple
possible sources was begun with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
metronidazole.  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated.  A
norepinephrine drip was required to maintain blood pressure in
adequate range.  Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and the patient also had stool positive for C. diff
toxin.  Vancomyin was discontinued after osteomyelitis was ruled
out as a possible infection in this patient.  The patient's
blood pressure was stable and the norepinephrine drip was
discontinued. She was transferred to 12R on the am of [**2179-10-26**].
On arrival to the floor her temp was 100, hr 90-110, bp 100/60.

1) ID:  On the floors she completed 14 day courses of both
flagyl and meropenem, and remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable throughout the remainder of her hospital course.

2) Leg Ulcers:  The patient was seen by vascular surgery who
felt that her ulcers were a combination of venous stasis and
pressure ulcers.  ABIs were not done as it would cause the
patient too much pain, and the patient was not felt to be a
surgical candidate regardless in light of her condition and
comorbidities.  Her dressings were changed once a day, however
this was causing her extreme pain, despite morphine and ativan
premedication, and dressing changes were decreased to every
three days, and then not at all.  She should not have any
further dressing changes, as the pain is excrutiating for her.

3) Anasarca/fluid balance/hypernatremia:  Ms. [**Known lastname 97599**] was
found to be intravascularly depleted (high sodium), but total
body fluid overloaded.  We attempted diuresis, but this only
elevated her sodium.  We therefore fluid resuscitated her to
lower her sodium, and then began diuresis once her hypernatremia
had resolved.  We had hoped that her fluid balance would improve
with initiation of TPN to raise her albumin, however, after a
week of TPN, her albumin continues to decrease, and she is not
eating anything.  Her anasarca persists.  She will get
maintenance IVF at [**Hospital3 2558**] with D5, in the absence of
other forms of nutrition.

4) Nutrition:  TPN was initiated through her central line on
[**10-29**].  Her albumin was 2.6 on [**10-21**], declining to 1.9 on [**11-3**].
She occasionally ate spoonfulls of pudding, however largely
refused food and PO medications.

5) Anemia:  The patient had a baseline hct ranging from 35-43
prior to admission, while declined to 29-31 for much of her
stay.  Her iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease, and
her stool was guaiac negative.  She did not receive any
transfusions.

6) Hypothyroidism:  Ms. [**Known lastname 95808**] was profoundly hypothyroid, with
a TSH of 8 on admission, increasing to 16 and then 30 at
discharge despite increasing her thyroxine dose (it takes [**6-22**]
weeks for the new dose to take effect, however the TSH should
not continue to rise to such an extent).

7) Pain:  Ms. [**Known lastname 95808**] [**Last Name (Titles) 97600**] anytime she was touched.  She
persistenly denied pain, only admitting to pain during her
dressing changes.  Despite this, she [**Last Name (Titles) 97600**] anytime anyone
touched her.  We decreased the frequency of her dressing changes
secondary to her extreme pain, and used morphine concentrated
solution 4 mg Q 4 hours for pain.  She should be given tylenol
1000 mg PR Q 6 hours as needed for pain, as well as morphine
concentrated solution 5 mg Q 4 hours around the clock.

8) Atrial fibrillation:  Her a-fib was poorly controlled with
digoxin in the unit, and not responsive to amiodarone.  On the
floors her rate was well-controlled in the 60s, though her pulse
was irregularly irregular.  She was therefore maintained on
digoxin and coumadin for anticoagulation.  Her coumadin was
maintained at 1 mg qhs and INR was therapeutic for the most
part.

9) Mental status:  The patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, but mostly was delirious.  She leaned to the right side,
with R lateral gaze preference.  A head CT was performed due to
concern for stroke, and was negative for any acute intracranial
process.

10) Code status:  She was DNR/DNI during the hospitalization.
During a family meeting with her long-time boyfriend [**Name (NI) **], for
whom she cares a lot, and who cares for her, on her last day of
hospitalization it was decided that in light of her failure to
demonstrate any improvement, persistent refusal to eat and
worsening albumin in spite of TPN, along with continued extreme
pain and incredibly poor prognosis, the best thing for her would
be comfort care only.  She should be given pain medications,
with PRN zyprexa for aggitation for the next 3 weeks.  Her
boyfriend, [**Name (NI) **], would like her to receive fluids for the time
being, in order to try to buy her a little bit more time to see
if she will eat.  It has been explained that this may only
prolong her life for a little while, and he will consider
stopping the fluids in the future.  She will get maintenance
fluids through her central line, which can be flushed with
heparin to keep it patent.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 75806**] is an 81 y/o F with a history of dCHF (EF 50-65%
in [**2133**]), afib, and chronic blood loss from GAVE syndrome who
presented today for elective EGD under MAC anesthesia. Per
endoscopy report, the findings were consistent with known
diagnosis of nodular gastric antral vascular ectasia. Mild
sponaneous oozing was noted. Band ligation was performed for
homeostasis. After the procedure the patient was complaining of
shortness of breath. She reports that she has been chronically
short of breath for 11 years, however she does not require any
oxygen at home. Of note the patient had not taken her lasix the
morning of the procedure and received 800cc of lactated ringers
during the endoscopy. She denies chest pain, cough, wheeze, or
leg pain. No known history of COPD or asthma. She reports that
her bilateral leg swelling is no worse than baseline (documented
to be 3+ edema in recent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]).
.
On arrival to the medicine floor she was desatting to the low
80s on nasal cannula and was placed on 5liter facemask. Her
blood pressures were in the 90s systolic which is slightly below
baseline according to outpatient records of 100s-110s systolic.
Heart rates 90s in afib. Diuresis was not initiated on the floor
because of concern for low blood pressures. The patient was
therefore transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. VS
prior to transfer were 87/57 87 20 99% on 5liter facemask. EKG
showed Atrial fibrillation with rate of 96, NA/NI no majors
change compared to prior.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient denies any chest pain. She
reports shortness of breath is improved while wearing the
oxygen.

[**Hospital1 18**] REPORTS/LABS-
[**12-20**] EKG-
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage throughout. Non-specific T wave
abnormality in the lateral leads. Abnormal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**12-20**]:
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Prominence of right
cardiac border could reflect enlarged right-sided cardiac
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**] or adjacent pericardial abnormality such as a
pericardial cyst or prominent fat pad. Attention to this on
standard PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the
patient's condition permits. No focal areas of consolidation are
present within the lungs. Questionable small pleural effusions,
which could also be more fully address by standard PA and
lateral chest radiographs.
.
EKG [**12-21**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage throughout. Abnormal tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment abnormalities are
resolved.
TRACING #2
.
ECHO [**Hospital1 18**] [**2136-12-20**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild
systolic dysfunction. Normal global and regional left
ventricular systolic function. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CXR [**2136-12-20**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
[**12-21**] LENI:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower
extremities.
.
VQ SCAN [**2136-12-21**]
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate some accumulation of tracer in the large airways.
Matched defects in the right lung base, is likely due to pleural
effusion.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show >2 mismatched
segmental defects in the right upper lobe and superior segment
of the right lower lobe.
Chest x-ray shows a small right pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly.
The above findings are consistent with a high likelihood ratio
for pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: High likelihood ratio of pulmonary embolism in the
right upper lobe.
.
Renal u/s [**12-22**]:
1. Limited study showing no evidence of hydronephrosis and no
direct evidence of venous clot.
2. Suggested reversal of diastaolic flow in the left renal
artery. The
significance of this is unclear given the limitations noted, and
may be
related to a high-resistance system including acute tubular
necrosis, or might be artifactual. If vascular thrombus is still
of concern, noncontrast MRV of the renal veins may be of use to
confirm patency.
3. Small bilateral kidneys, consistent with chronic medical
renal disease.
.
EKG [**12-22**]-
Significant baseline artifact precludes an accurate
interpretation of the
rhythm. No clear P waves are seen suggesting possible atrial
fibrillation.  Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 of unclear
significance. No other interpretation is possible based on this
tracing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-12-20**] atrial
fibrillation is likely still present.
.
EKG [**12-22**]:
FINDINGS: Since [**2136-12-20**], mild right pleural effusion
and mild to
moderate right basilar atelectasis is worse. Mildly enlarged
heart size is
stable and a suspicion for pericardial effusion was raised.
Findings were
discussed with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who mentioned regarding recent
echocardiogrpaphy which revealed sever cardiomegaly secondary to
multivalvular involvement, but no pericardial effusion. Aorta is
generally larger, however, there is no evidence of a focal
aneurysm. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2136-12-25**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-22**], there is
further
accumulation of fluid within the right pleural space with
compressive
atelectasis. The upper right lung and the entire left lung are
clear with no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o female with a history of chronic diastolic CHF (EF 50-65%
in [**2133**]), atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin, and chronic
blood loss anemia from gasric antral vascular ectasias admitted
with hypoxemia following endoscopic banding of her gastric AVMs.

#Hypoxemia/Acute vs. chronic pulmonary embolism/Chronic
diastolic heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension:
Etiology of acute onset worsening hypoxemia on admission was
initially not obvious.  Physical exam was consistent with volume
overload but exam was complicated by tricuspid regurgitation and
v-waves to the jaw. Aspiration was considered but absence of
significant lung pathology on exam or chest X-ray made this less
likely. A V/Q scan was performed and was read as having high
probability for PE in the right upper lobe. Additionally, an
echocardiogram was notable for preserved EF, but with mod-severe
mitral regurgitation, right ventricular dilatation and reduced
systolic function with severe tricuspid regurgitation and the
presence of a PFO (No valsalva or agitated saline contrast
maneuvers were performed). These echo findings were similar to
echo in [**2130**].
.
Given her multiple contraindications for anticoagulation,
including history of requiring blood transfusions every 10 days
for her gastric AVMs transfusion dependance and recurrent GI
bleeds, anticoagulation was not pursued. Additionally, bilateral
lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT, so an IVC
filter was not placed. Despite lack of intervention, the patient
improved slowly with reduced oxygen requirement with
re-initiation of diuretic regimen.
The risks and benefits of anticoagulation and the current
clinical dilemma were discussed with the patient and the
patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2136-12-25**] and pt's son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 75806**] on [**2136-12-25**].
In addition, pt was given 1 unit of PRBCs during admission.
However, should the patient get to a place where she may only
require monthly transfusion or should she develop chest pain,
hypotension, tachycardia, increasing hypoxia, etc, the
risk/benefit ratio of anticoagulation for PE may change to favor
anticoagulation. In addition, the patient also did not show
signs of a hemodynamically significant PE. She did have periods
of relative hypotension during times of afib with RVR. Pt
carries a diagnosis of afib prior to admission and her BP was
improved predictably with better HR control. In addition, there
was question of the acute vs. chronic PE. The echo findings
appear to be present in [**2130**] and could be explained by her
valvular disease. Pt had sats of ~94-96% on RA, ambulatory sats
92-93% on RA. However, pt did experience occasional noctural
hypoxia to 84% on RA and was therefore sent home with home
oxygen at 1-2L nightly for now. Troponins 0.02 x3, BNP ~4000
during admission. Oxygenation much improved during admission.
VNA can also help with monitoring for hypoxia. Pt has a
scheduled appointment with her cardiologist and PCP after DC to
continue this discussion. Can discuss whether patient may
benefit from an IVC filter in the future.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Not on coumadin or aspirin due to chronic
GI bleeding. The patient is on rate control with atenolol at
home (25mg TID?). She was restarted on metoprolol given her
renal failure and CKD and this was uptitrated to 25mg TID by day
of discharge. Pt tolerated this well and seemed to have better
BP's with appropriate rate control. BP range 90's-110's during
admission. She did have periods of afib with RVR prior to
uptitration of meds. She was discharged with VNA for
cardiopulmonary monitoring.
.
#Chronic blood loss anemia/Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia
[GAVE] s/p banding on the day of admission: She requires
transfusion ~every 2 weeks at the present time. Work up to date
has included multiple EGDs with argon plasma coagulation which
has been unsuccessful thus far and therefore patient had
scheduled EGD on admission for banding. The patient did have
drop in her hematocrit during her admission and was transfused 1
unit PRBCs. A repeat EGD with banding was recommended in 1 month
follow-up with GI. HCT on discharge was 28. She was instructed
to have repeat HCT at PCP follow up.
.
#Chronic diastolic heart failure: continued outpt regimen of
lasix, BB
.
# LE edema: She reports chronic worsening bilateral LE edema
over the last 5-6 weeks. LENIs were negative for PE. Pt was
continued on lasix therapy
.
#Hypertension: Home anti-hypertensives were initially held upon
admission and then restarted. She was discharged on metoprolol
25mg TID
.
# Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on home simvastatin.
.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Home oral medications including
glipizide were held on admission. She was treated with an
insulin sliding scale. She was instructed to resume glipizide
upon discharge.
.
# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on levothyroxine.
.
#Acute-on-Chronic renal failure, stage II-III: Her renal
function on admission was 1.6 and rose to 1.8, but improved
during admission. Cr on discharge was 1.1. Pt should also have
repeat Cr at PCP f/u to ensure continued improvement.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Code: DNR/I

Follow-up: Repeat EGD and banding with GI in 1 month
Should have PCP and Cardiology follow up given chronic diastolic
heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and now PE with minimal
therapeutic options. Should discuss whether there may be benefit
to IVC filter in the future.

Discharge Instructions:
You were initially admitted to the hospital after an elective
endoscopic banding procedure for the abnormal blood vessels in
your stomach causing gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic
anemia.  After the procedure, you were noted to have low blood
pressure and low oxygen levels, due most likely to a combination
of an aspiration event(inhaling some of your mouth secretions)
and also to a blood clot (pulmonary embolism) in the lungs.
However, after discussion with the GI specialists, given the
risk of bleeding, especially in the GI tract, we have decided
not to put you on blood thinning medication for the lung clot.
You initially required a significant amount of oxygen, however,
your oxygen levels improved and you will only need oxygen at
night time for now. You will be continuing this discussion with
your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge.
.
Also, your kidney function was slightly impaired during
admission. This improved, but should be followed up after
discharge.
.
Medication changes:
1.your atenolol was changed to metoprolol given your kidney
function. Your discharge dose will be 25mg of metoprolol three
times a day.
Stop taking atenolol.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2189-2-26**] for surgical
management of his aneurysm. He underwent preoperative testing
and was placed on Heparin as he had been off his Coumadin for
five days. On [**2189-2-27**], he was taken to the Operating Room where
he underwent replacement of his ascending aorta and hemiarch
with reimplantation of his saphenous vein grafts. Please see
operative note for details. Due to a coagulopathy, he was left
with an open chest and taken to the intensive care unit.

He received multiple blood products for his coagulopathy. The
renal service was consulted for acute renal failure and possible
need for dialysis. He was aggressively diuresed and his renal
function stabilized. On [**2189-3-2**], he was returned to the
Operating rRoom where he underwent mediastinal washout and
sternal closure. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. On [**2189-3-4**] he awoke and was extubated.
He had some confusion but was without any focal deficits. His
renal function continued to improve. He was placed on Amiodarone
for ventricular tachycardia in the OR.  EP followed the patient.
 He developed first degree AV block and beta blocker was held
until it resolved.  He then vascilated between sinus rhythm and
AFib.  Coumadin was resumed for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
.
Vascular surgery was consulted and ruled out compartment
syndrome in the right lower extremity.

Leukocytosis developed to a peak of [**Numeric Identifier 14157**] and he was
pan-cultured. Infectious Disease was consulted.  Cultures were
unrevealing, CDiff toxin was negative on 4 occassions and torso
and leg CT were negative for source. The patient was started
empirically on Flagyl with a fall in the white count.  Other
antibiotics were stopped and the Flagyl changed to oral
Vancomycin per Infectious Disease.  He will be treated with a 14
day course of PO vancomycin in the setting of persistent
leukocytosis and loose stool. Ultrasound of the edematous right
leg revealed only edema, no focal collections.

despite being below his preoperative weight he continued to have
edema and diuretics were continued. Spironolactone was given due
to his underlying heart failure.

On [**3-16**] his WBC had fallen to 13,500, he was afebrile and felt
well. He was trasnsferred to Genesis [**Hospital 11252**] rehab . Follow up
appointments were made and medications are as listed.

structures. Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter is
preserved. There are white matter chronic infarctions and basal
ganglia lacunes. There is prominence of the sulci and
ventricles, consistent with atrophy.

Otherwise, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are within
normal limits.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic
microvascular and lacunar infarction.
COMPARISON: Comparison is made to [**2158-4-8**].

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial
infarcts. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
There are chronic periventricular hypodensities consistent with
chronic ischemic changes. There is a round hypodense area in the
left frontal lobe that is unchanged compared to the prior study
and most likely represents an old lacune. The paranasal sinuses
are normally aerated.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF-etiology likely inadequate afterload reduction (no ACE
inhibitor and low dose lasix.) Possible EF significantly lower
than pre-CABG LV gram indicated.  He diuresed well with
nesiritide gtt accompanied by boluses of Lasix (responded to
lasix 100 mg IV).  He was able to be extubated on [**4-4**] after
considerable diuresis.  He also had a thoracentesis (pleural
fluid c/w transudate), which was complicated by a pneumothorax
on the right.  Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube, which was
able to be discontinued 2 days later (ptx resolved).
His medical management was optimized.  His ACE inhibitor was
titrated up along with his metoprolol to 100 mg TID, and he
still had relatively poor bp control, in the 130s to 150s.
Aldactone was added.  He was placed on standing lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **]
which was decreased to once a day, as well as ASA and a statin.

2. Hypoxemia-likely all due to CHF but question of infiltrate on
initial CXR.  His sputum grew GNR but culture negative.  He was
originally placed on vanc/zosyn, but was changed to levaquin for
total 7 day course.  He remained afebrile.  His oxygen
saturation improved greatly with diuresis.

3. Afib-labled chronic.  His coumadin was originally held, and
he was placed on a heparin gtt.  This was discontinued when he
had the chest tube placed.  His coumadin was restarted when the
tube was pulled, and he was not bridged with heparin given the
risk of bleeding. His INR was supratherapeutic upon discharge
and his INR should be checked by his visiting nurse the day
after discharge.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis-likely contraction from diuresis.
Improved with diamox, although not resolved.  Question if pt has
hyperaldo - hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and difficult to treat
hypertension.  However, he would need to have all his diuretics
stop to appropriately diagnose this, and that isn't feasible at
this time.

5. Psych: He was intermittently confused and agitated throughout
his course.  He was originally kept on his outpatient regimen of
seroquel 25 qhs and zyprexa 2.5 tid.  He was evaluated by
psychiatry who recommended a delirium workup.  His head CT was
neg, as was his TSH. Psychiatry recommended discontinuing the
zyprexa and seroquel and instead recommended standing haldol TID
and [**Hospital1 **] prn for agitation. At times, the patient exhibited
extreme behavior by verbally attacking his nurses and
physicians.

6. Gout:  He developed an erythematous, painful R MTP joint,
which was treated wiht prednisone 30 mg po qd x 2 d.  Because of
his altered mental status, which became acutely worse the same
day the steroids were started, he only had 2 days of prednisone.
 His toe pain resolved, and the steroids were discontinued
(?steroid psychosis).

7. Hematuria-Foley catheter was placed last admission in [**1-14**].
This was placed by urology with cystoscopy and ureteral dilation
secondary to anatomical difficulty from BPH. Foley was removed
this admission as it had been in place for three months. Due to
urinary incontinence and skin breakdown from fungal infection
the catheter was replaced by urology. It should be removed once
skin condition improves.

8. Clostridium Difficile Colitis: Patient had been started on
oral vancomycin for clostridium difficile colitis diagnosed at
[**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center. (Presumably he was
started on vancomycin since had previously been treated
[**Date range (1) 40058**] for C difficile colitis with Flagyl and this was
assumed to be a relapse.) He completed his course on [**2158-4-7**],
however, continued to have diarrhea with positive C diff toxin.
Therefore, the vancomycin was restarted on [**2158-4-12**] with plan for
10 days to complete [**2158-4-21**]. Flagyl was added for a ten day
course ([**2158-4-15**] to [**2158-4-25**]).

9. Placement: Many discussions with the family were made. The
patient's wife felt that he had suffered emotionally and
physically in a rehab hospital where he recently stayed and
refused to place him in another rehab hospital. Instead, she
felt that the patient was nearing the end of his life and
preferred him to be home for his quality of life and happiness.
All those actively involved in Mr. [**Known lastname 40059**] care, including
nurses, doctors, and case managers, advised his wife that caring
for Mr. [**Known lastname 2523**] required a high degree of nursing care and were
strongly against sending the patient home as he appeared
medically unfit. However, Mrs. [**Known lastname 2523**] insisted on taking him
home. As a result, case management was involved in setting up
home VNA and maximal medical services available. In addition,
the wife met on several occasions with the nursing staff to care
for her husband under nursing supervision and guidance 5-6 days
before discharge. As the patient is at risk for aspiration and
thus must remain strictly NPO, his wife was also provided
teaching regarding tube feeding through his PEG.

10. On the day of discharge, the patient was found to have a
urinary tract infection (he has a chronic foley in place). Thus,
he was given Levaquin for 10 days for a complicated UTI.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: bleed?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
27 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bleed?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST.

HISTORY: Status post fall. Question hemorrhage.

Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain. No
contrast was administered. No prior brain imaging studies are
available for comparison.

FINDINGS: There is a left frontal scalp hematoma. There is no
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. No fractures are
identified. There is no evidence of edema or mass effect.

CONCLUSION: Left frontal scalp hematoma. Otherwise, normal
study.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT CERVICAL SPINE [**2157-7-29**]

HISTORY: Status post fall.

Contiguous axial images were obtained through the cervical
spine. No contrast was administered. No prior spine imaging
studies are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is normal. No
fractures are identified. There is no evidence of prevertebral
soft tissue swelling. Non-contrast CT has limited sensitivity
for intraspinal soft tissue abnormalities such as disc
protrusion or hematoma. Within the limits of this examination,
no such abnormalities are detected. However, if this is a
clinical concern, an MR examination would be required.

CONCLUSION: Normal study. No evidence of fracture or
subluxation.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. He was placed on bedrest
and monitored closely; serial hematocrits and physcial exams
were followed closely as well. Plastic surgery was consulted for
